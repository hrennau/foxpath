## The <exportanchors> element is used to delay conref resolution within DITA
##       documents. This allows you to process or display DITA content in a way that will resolve only
##       some of the conref values in that content, while remaining values are left for later
##       resolution. The element contains a list of IDs or keys that should not be resolved during the
##       initial preparation of the content for display; those IDs and keys will be preserved after
##       that preparation, as will the conref relationship itself.
exportanchors.element =
  element exportanchors { exportanchors.attlist, exportanchors.content }

anchorid.attributes =
  attribute keyref { text }?,
  attribute id { xsd:NMTOKEN },
  conref-atts,
  select-atts,
  localization-atts,
  attribute outputclass { text }?

## The <anchorid> element allows an author to define a conref target that will
##       be resolved dynamically when rendered for an end user of the content. This element is useful
##       when doing an initial process of the DITA content prior to final rendering of the content; it
##       causes specified IDs to be preserved after that process, and conref relationships that reuse
##       the element will not be resolved during the initial process.
anchorid.element =
  element anchorid { anchorid.attlist, anchorid.content }
anchorid.attlist &= anchorid.attributes
# LONG NAME: Anchor Key
anchorkey.content = empty
anchorkey.attributes =

## The <anchorkey> element allows an author to define a conref target that will
##       be resolved dynamically when rendered for an end user of the content. This element is useful
##       when doing an initial process of the DITA content prior to final rendering of the content; it
##       allows specified keys to be preserved after that process, and conref relationships which use
##       that key will not be resolved during that initial process.
