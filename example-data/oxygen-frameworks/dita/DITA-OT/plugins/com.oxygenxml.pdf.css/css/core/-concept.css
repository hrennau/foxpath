 * DITA concept topics answer "What is..." questions. 
 * Use the concept topic to introduce the background or 
 * overview information for tasks or reference topics. 
 * The concept topic restricts content following a section 
 * or example to other sections or examples.

 * <concept>
 * 
 * The <concept> element is the top-level element for a topic 
 * that answers the question "what is?" Concepts provide background 
 * information that users must know before they can successfully 
 * work with a product or interface. Often, a concept is an extended 
 * definition of a major abstraction such as a process or function. 
 * It might also have an example or a graphic, but generally the 
 * structure of a concept is fairly simple.

 * 
 * The <conbodydiv> element is similar to the <bodydiv> 
 * element in that it provides an informal container for 
 * content that may be grouped within a concept. There 
 * are no additional semantics attached to the conbodydiv 
 * element; it is purely a grouping element provided to
