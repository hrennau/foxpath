 * 
 * The <abbreviated-form> element represents a reference 
 * to a term that may appear in an abbreviated form (often 
 * an acronym). The long and short forms of the term are 
 * generally defined in a <glossentry> topic. Processors 
 * should display the referenced term when rendering an 
 * <abbreviated-form> element.
 *  
 * Inherits styles from parent class:
 *  
 *     + topic/term  
 * 
 * Because of its @keyref attribute, it is decorated with 
 * a link (a generic selector not in this CSS).

/* ====================================
 *
 * <glossref>
 * 
 * The <glossref> element is a convenience element in maps 
 * for creating a reference to a glossary topic. It has a 
 * required keys attribute, which forces the author to create 
 * a key by which inline terms may reference their definition. 
 * For example, when glossentry topics are used to define 
 * acronyms, this will remind authors to create a key which 
 * <abbreviated-form> elements may use to reference the 
 * short and expanded versions of that acronym.
 *  
 * Inherits styles from parent class:
 *  
 *     + map/topicref  
 * 
 * Because of its @keyref attribute, it is decorated with 
 * a link (a generic selector not in this CSS).
 * 
 * Needs the [keys] to override the content defined by the 
 * map/topicref CSS selector of the same precedence.
