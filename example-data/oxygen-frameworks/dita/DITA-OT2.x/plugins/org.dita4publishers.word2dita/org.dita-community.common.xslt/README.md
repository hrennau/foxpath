org.dita-community.common.xslt
==============================

Basic support XSLT libraries useful for any XSLT transform: relpath_utils.xsl and dita-support-lib.xsl. Intended for use with the DITA Open Toolkit but not limited to that use.

NOTE: This project uses git submodules. After you clone the repository you must run the following git commands from the project
directory.

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

To get the submodules and update them.

Whenever a submodule changes, or whenever you think about it, run this command:

    git submodule foreach git pull

This will get the latest versions of all the submodules.

See the project Wiki pages for details.
