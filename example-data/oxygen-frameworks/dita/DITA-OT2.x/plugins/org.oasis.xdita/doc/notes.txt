- Created branch 0.1 to hold old files like those related to concept, task and reference.
- Cut DTDs down to topic and map.


----------------------
earlier:

adding dl
removing note
changing from simpletable to a constrained table
changing from map title to just a navtitle in map metadata

todo:
selectively add back in prolog metadata
specializing more elements into ph vocab, bundling as html5 extensions
add block specialization support - for object at least (so we can have audio/video elements)

add back in prolog data elem?
add in missing elem in video/object
