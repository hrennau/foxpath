org.dita-community.mapdriven
============================

Provides general map-driven processing framework support.

These XSLT modules manage collection of data across an entire
publication, allowing things like cross-publication numbering,
back-of-the-book index generation, navigation list generation,
etc.

The data structures produced by these processes are then intended
to be passed as tunnel parameters to the processing of topics
in the context of the navigation topicrefs that refer to them.
