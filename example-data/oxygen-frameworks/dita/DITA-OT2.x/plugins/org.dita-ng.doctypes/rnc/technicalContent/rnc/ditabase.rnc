  ##         you create documents using the ditabase document type. The <dita> element lets you create
  ##         any sequence of concept, task, and reference topics, and the ditabase document type lets you
  ##         further nest these topic types inside each other. The <dita> element has no particular
  ##         output implications; it simply allows you to create multiple topics of different types at
  ##         the same level in a single document.
