      <p>The <code>&lt;component&gt;</code> element describes the component of the product that this
         topic is concerned with. For example, a product might be made up of many components, each
         of which is installable separately. Components might also be shared by several products so
         that the same component is available for installation with many products. An implementation
         may (but need not) use this identification to check cross-component dependencies when some
         components are installed, but not others. An implementation may also (but need not) use the
         identification to make sure that topics are hidden, removed, or flagged in some way when
         the component they describe isn't installed. </p>
