      <p>The <code>&lt;context&gt;</code> element provides background information for a task. This
         information helps the user understand what the purpose of the task is and what they will
         gain by completing the task. This section should be brief and does not replace or recreate
         a concept topic on the same subject, although the context section might include some
         conceptual information. </p>
