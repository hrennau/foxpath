      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;subjectRel&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;subjectRel&gt;</code> element contains a set of subjects that are related in
         some manner. Each group of subjects is contained in a <code>&lt;subjectRole&gt;</code>
         element; the associations between different columns in the same row are evaluated in the
         same way as those in a <code>&lt;relrow&gt;</code> (from which
            <code>&lt;subjectRel&gt;</code> is specialized) but define relationships between the
         subjects instead of links between topic documents. </p>
