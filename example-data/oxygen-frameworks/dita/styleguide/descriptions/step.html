      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;step&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;step&gt;</code> element represents an action that a user must follow to
         accomplish a task. Each step in a task must contain a command <code>&lt;cmd&gt;</code>
         element which describes the particular action the user must do to accomplish the overall
         task. Beginning with DITA 1.2, it is possible to place a <code>&lt;note&gt;</code> element
         before the command in order to notify the user of dangers or other important information
         about the step. The <code>&lt;step&gt;</code> element can also contain additional optional
         information about the step, such as sub-steps, a list of choices, or result
         information.</p>
