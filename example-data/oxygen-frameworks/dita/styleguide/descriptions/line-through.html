      <p>The <code>&lt;line-through&gt;</code>element element indicates text that should be rendered
         with a line struck through the content. This element is designed to enable authors to
         indicate a deletion or revision for rhetorical purpose; it is not intended to be used for
         indicating revisions. This element is part of the highlighting domain. Use this element
         only when a more semantically appropriate element is not available. </p>
