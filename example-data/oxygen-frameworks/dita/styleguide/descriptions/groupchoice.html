      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;groupchoice&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;groupchoice&gt;</code> element is part of the subset of elements that define
         syntax diagrams in DITA. A group is a logical set of pieces of syntax that go together. A
         group choice specifies that the user must make a choice about which part of the syntax to
         use. Groups are often nested. This element is part of the DITA programming domain, a
         special set of DITA elements designed to document programming tasks, concepts, and
         reference information.</p>
