      <p>The <code>&lt;bodydiv&gt;</code> element is used to contain informal blocks of information
         within the body of a topic. The <code>&lt;bodydiv&gt;</code> element is specifically
         designed to be a grouping element, without any explicit semantics, other than to organize
         subsets of content into logical groups that are not intended or should not be contained as
         a topic. As such, it does not contain an explicit title to avoid enabling the creation of
         deeply nested content that would otherwise be written as separate topics. Content that
         requires a title should use a <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element or a nested topic. </p>
