      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;title&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element contains a heading or label for the main parts of a
         topic: the topic as a whole, sections, examples, and labelled content such as figures and
         tables. The element also can be used to provide a title for a map or a relationship table;
         when used in a relationship table, the title typically is used as a authoring convenience
         and is not rendered for display to an end user. </p>
