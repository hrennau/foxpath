      <p>The role attribute defines the role the target topic plays in relationship with the current
         topic. For example, in a parent/child relationship, the role would be "parent" when the
         target is the parent of the current topic, and "child" when the target is the child of the
         current topic. This structure could be used to sort and classify links at display time.
