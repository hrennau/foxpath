      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;anchorkey&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;anchorkey&gt;</code> element allows an author to define a
            <code>@conref</code> target that will be resolved dynamically when rendered for an end
         user of the content. This element is useful when doing an initial process of the DITA
         content prior to final rendering of the content; it allows specified keys to be preserved
         after that process, and conref relationships which use that key will not be resolved during
         that initial process. </p>
