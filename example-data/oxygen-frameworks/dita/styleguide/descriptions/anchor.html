                                                  provides an integration point that another map can
                                                  reference in order to insert its navigation into
                                                  the referenced map's navigation tree. For those
                                                  familiar with Eclipse help systems, this serves
                                                  the same purpose as the
                                                  <code>&lt;anchor&gt;</code> element in that
                                                  system. It might not be supported for all output
                                                  formats.</p>
