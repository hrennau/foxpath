      <p>A <code>&lt;lcArea&gt;</code> was deprecated in DITA version 1.3. It was replaced with the
            <code>&lt;lcArea2&gt;</code> element. It was originally intended to define an area of a
         hotspot image that contains a correct or incorrect choice in a hotspot assessment
         interaction. </p>
