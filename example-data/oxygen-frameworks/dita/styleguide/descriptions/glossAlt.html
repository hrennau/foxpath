      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;glossAlt&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;glossAlt&gt;</code> element contains a variant term for the preferred term.
         The variant should have the same meaning as the term in the <code>&lt;glossterm&gt;</code>
         element; the variant is simply another way to refer to the same term. There may be many
         ways to refer to a term; each variant is placed in its own <code>&lt;glossAlt&gt;</code>
         element. The <code>&lt;glossUsage&gt;</code> element may be used within
            <code>&lt;glossAlt&gt;</code> to indicate when use of the alternate term is appropriate. </p>
