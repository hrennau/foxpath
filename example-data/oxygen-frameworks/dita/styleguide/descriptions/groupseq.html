      <p>The <code>&lt;groupseq&gt;</code> element is part of the subset of elements that define
         syntax diagrams in DITA. A group is a logical set of pieces of syntax that go together.
         Within the syntax definition, groups of keywords, delimiters and other syntax units act as
         a combined unit, and they occur in a specific sequence, as delimited by the
            <code>&lt;groupseq&gt;</code> element. This element is part of the DITA programming
         domain, a special set of DITA elements designed to document programming tasks, concepts,
         and reference information.</p>
