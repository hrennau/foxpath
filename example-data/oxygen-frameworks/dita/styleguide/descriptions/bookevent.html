      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;bookevent&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;bookevent&gt;</code> element indicates a general event in the publication
         history of a book. This is an appropriate element for specialization if the current set of
         specific book event types does not meet your needs. If an element already exists to
         describe a specific type of event, such as <code>&lt;reviewed&gt;</code>,
            <code>&lt;edited&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;approved&gt;</code>, that element should be
         used instead. </p>
