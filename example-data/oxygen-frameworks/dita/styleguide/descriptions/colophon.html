      <p>The <code>&lt;colophon&gt;</code> element references a topic describing how this document
         was created. In publishing, a colophon describes details of the production of a book. This
         information generally includes the typefaces used, and often the names of their designers;
         the paper, ink and details of the binding materials and methods may also receive mention.
         In the case of technical books, a colophon may specify the software used to prepare the
         text and diagrams for publication. The <code>&lt;colophon&gt;</code> may appear in the
            <code>&lt;frontmatter&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;backmatter&gt;</code>. </p>
