      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;taskbody&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;taskbody&gt;</code> element is the main body-level element inside a task
         topic. A task body is designed to contain information specific to completing a task, such
         as prerequisites, contextual information, and steps. DITA 1.2 introduced a much looser
            <code>&lt;taskbody&gt;</code> content model in order to allow for more variations in the
         structure of a task. A constraint module was also provided in order to maintain
         compatibility with the previous strict model; this constraint is used in the default task
         distributed by OASIS. </p>
