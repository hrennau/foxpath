      <p>The <code>&lt;anchorid&gt;</code> element allows an author to define a <code>@conref</code>
         target that will be resolved dynamically when rendered for an end user of the content. This
         element is useful when doing an initial process of the DITA content prior to final
         rendering of the content; it causes specified IDs to be preserved after that process, and
            <code>@conref</code> relationships that reuse the element will not be resolved during
         the initial process. </p>
