      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;state&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;state&gt;</code> element specifies a name/value pair whenever it is necessary
         to represent a named state that has a variable value. The element is primarily intended for
         use in specializations to represent specific states (like logic circuit states, chemical
         reaction states, airplane instrumentation states, and so forth). </p>
