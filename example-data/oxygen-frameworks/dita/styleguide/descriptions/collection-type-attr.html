      <p>The @collection-type attribute specifies how the children of a &lt;topicref> element relate
         to their parent and to each other. This attribute, which is set on the parent element,
         typically is used by processors to determine how to generate navigation links in the
         rendered topics. For example, a @collection-type value of "sequence" indicates that
         children of the specifying &lt;topicref> element represent an ordered sequence of topics;
         processors might add numbers to the list of child topics or generate next/previous links
         for online presentation. Where the @collection-type attribute is available on elements that
         cannot directly contain elements (such as &lt;reltable> or &lt;relcolspec>), the behavior
         of the attribute is reserved for future use. </p>
