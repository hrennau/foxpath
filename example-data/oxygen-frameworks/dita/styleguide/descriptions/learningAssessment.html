      <p>A Learning Assessment topic presents questions or interactions that measure progress,
         encourage recollection, and stimulate reinforcement of the learning content, and can be
         presented before the content as a pre-assessment or as a post-assessment test. The
         interactions use a sub-set of the Question-Test Interoperability (QTI) specification,
         implemented as a DITA domain specialization. </p>
