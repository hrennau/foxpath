      <p>The <code>&lt;lcMultipleSelect&gt;</code> element was deprecated in DITA version 1.3. It
         was replaced with the <code>&lt;lcMultipleSelect2&gt;</code> element. It was originally
         intended to provide an interaction where the learner must indicate two or more correct
         answers from a list of choices. </p>
