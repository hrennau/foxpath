      <p>The <code>&lt;lcHotspotMap&gt;</code> was deprecated in DITA version 1.3. It was replaced
         with the <code>&lt;lcHotspotMap2&gt;</code> element. It was originally intended to let you
         designate an action area or region over an image, allowing a click in that region to get
         scored as correct or incorrect in response to an interaction question. </p>
