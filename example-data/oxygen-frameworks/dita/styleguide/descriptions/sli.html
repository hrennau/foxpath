      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;sli&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;sli&gt;</code> element is an item in a simple list (&lt;sl&gt;). Simple list
         items have phrase or text content, adequate for describing package contents, for example.
         When a DITA topic is formatted for output, the items of a simple list should be placed each
         on its own line, with no other prefix such as a number (as in an ordered list) or bullet
         (as in an unordered list). </p>
