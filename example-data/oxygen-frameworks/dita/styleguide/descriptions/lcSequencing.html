      <p>The <code>&lt;lcSequencing&gt;</code> element was deprecated in DITA version 1.3. It was
         replaced with the <code>&lt;lcSequencing2&gt;</code> element. It was originally intended to
         ask the learner to arrange a list of choices into a predefined order, such as small to
         large. </p>
