      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;keydef&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;keydef&gt;</code> element is a convenience element that is used to define
         keys without any of the other effects that occur when using a <code>&lt;topicref&gt;</code>
         element: no content is included in output, no title is included in the table of contents,
         and no linking or other relationships are defined. The <code>&lt;keydef&gt;</code> element
         is not the only way to define keys; its purpose is to simplify the process by defaulting
         several attributes to achieve the described behaviors. </p>
