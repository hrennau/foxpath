      <p>The @domains attribute serves two primary purposes:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>To indicate to DITA processors the specific features that they should or must provide
            in order to completely process the document.</li>
         <li>To determine the validity of elements that are copied from one DITA document to
            another. This copying may occur as the result of a content reference (conref) or key
            reference (keyref), or may occur in the context of an author editing a DITA
            document.</li>
      </ul>
