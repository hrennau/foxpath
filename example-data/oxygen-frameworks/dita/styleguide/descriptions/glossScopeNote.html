      <p>The <code>&lt;glossScopeNote&gt;</code> element contains a clarification of the subject
         that is designated by the <code>&lt;glossterm&gt;</code>, such as examples of included or
         excluded companies or products. For instance, a scope note for "Linux" might explain that
         the term doe not apply to UNIX products; it might give examples of Linux products that are
         included as well as UNIX products that are excluded. </p>
