      <p>The <code>&lt;lcMatching&gt;</code> element was deprecated in DITA version 1.3. It was
         replaced with the <code>&lt;lcMatching2&gt;</code> element. It was originally intended to
         allow the learner to identify the correct choice that matches another choice and,
         optionally, any feedback for the pair or for correct or incorrect matches. </p>
