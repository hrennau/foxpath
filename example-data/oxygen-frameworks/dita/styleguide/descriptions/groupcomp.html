      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;groupcomp&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;groupcomp&gt;</code> element is part of the subset of elements that define
         syntax diagrams in DITA. A group is a logical set of pieces of syntax that go together. The
         group composite means that the items that make up the syntax diagram will be formatted
         close together rather than being separated by a horizontal or vertical line, which is the
         usual formatting method. This element is part of the DITA programming domain, a special set
         of DITA elements designed to document programming tasks, concepts, and reference
         information.</p>
