      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;syntaxdiagram&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;syntaxdiagram&gt;</code> element is the main container for all the syntax
         elements that make up a syntax definition. The syntax diagram represents the syntax of a
         statement from a computer language or a command, function call, or programming language
         statement. Traditionally, the syntax diagram is formatted with "railroad tracks" that
         connect the units of the syntax together, but the presentation might differ depending on
         the output media. This element is part of the DITA programming domain, a special set of
         DITA elements designed to document programming tasks, concepts, and reference
         information.</p>
