      <p>The <code>&lt;concept&gt;</code> element is the top-level element for a topic that answers
         the question "what is?" Concepts provide background information that users must know before
         they can successfully work with a product or interface. Often, a concept is an extended
         definition of a major abstraction such as a process or function. It might also have an
         example or a graphic, but generally the structure of a concept is fairly simple. </p>
