      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;reference&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;reference&gt;</code> element defines a top-level container for a reference
         topic. Reference topics document programming constructs or facts about a product. Examples
         of reference topics include (but are not limited to) product specifications, environmental
         specifications, equipment lists, parts lists, required tools, language elements, class
         descriptions, commands, functions, and API information. All of these topics provide quick
         access to facts, but they do not contain a deeper explanation of related concepts or tasks. </p>
