      <p>The @keyscope attribute consists of one or more space-separated key scope names. Map
         authors define the boundaries for key scopes by specifying the @keyscope attribute on
         &lt;map> elements, &lt;topicref> elements, or elements that are specializations of &lt;map>
         or &lt;topicref>. Such elements, their contents, and any locally-scoped content referenced
         from within the element, are considered to be part of the scope. Keys defined within a
         scope are only directly referenceable from within the same scope. They can be referenced
         from the parent scope using the scope's name, followed by a period, followed by the key
         name.</p>
