      <p>The <code>&lt;lcMatchingPair&gt;</code> element was deprecated in DITA version 1.3. It was
         replaced with the <code>&lt;lcMatchingPair2&gt;</code> element. It was originally intended
         to provide a table row with the pair of items that comprise a correct match in a matching
         interaction and, optionally, feedback on the pair or correct and incorrect matches. </p>
