   <body>
      <p>A generic attribute that has no specific purpose. It is intended to act as a base for
         specialized attributes that have a simple value syntax like the conditional processing
         attributes (one or more alphanumeric values separated by whitespace), but is not itself a
         filtering or flagging attribute. The attribute takes a space-delimited set of values.
         However, when acting as a container for generalized attributes, the content model will be
         more complex.</p>
