      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;linkpool&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;linkpool&gt;</code> element defines a group of links that have common
         characteristics, such as type or audience or source. When links are in
            <code>&lt;related-links&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;linkpool&gt;</code> elements, the
         organization of links on final output is determined by the output process, not by the order
         that the links actually occur in the DITA topic. </p>
