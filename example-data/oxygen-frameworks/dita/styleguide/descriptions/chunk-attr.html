   <body><p>Specifies that the processor generates an interim set of DITA topics that are used as
         the input for the final processing. This can produce the following output results:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>Multi-topic files are transformed into smaller files, for example, individual HTML
            files for each DITA topic.</li>
         <li>Individual DITA topics are combined into a single file. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Specifying a value for the @chunk attribute on a &lt;map> element establishes chunking
         behavior that applies to the entire map, unless overridden by @chunk attributes that are
         set on more specific elements in the DITA map. For a detailed description of the @chunk
         attribute and its usage, see <a
