      <p>The <code>&lt;troubleshooting&gt;</code> element is the top-level element for a
         troubleshooting topic. Troubleshooting topics document corrective action such as
         troubleshooting or alarm clearing. Troubleshooting topics begin with a description of a
         condition that the reader might want to correct, followed by one or more cause-remedy
         pairs. Each cause-remedy pair is a potential solution to the trouble described in the
         condition. </p>
