      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;required-cleanup&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>A <code>&lt;required-cleanup&gt;</code> element is used as a placeholder for migrated
         elements that cannot be appropriately tagged without manual intervention. As the element
         name implies, the intent for authors is to clean up the contained material and eventually
         remove the <code>&lt;required-cleanup&gt;</code> element. Authors should not insert this
         element into documents. </p>
