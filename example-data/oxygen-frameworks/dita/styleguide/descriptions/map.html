      <p>The <code>&lt;map&gt;</code> element describes the relationships among a set of resources,
         such as DITA topics. Maps consist of references to topics, maps, and other resources
         organized into hierarchies, groups, and tables. Maps express these relationships in a
         single common format that can be used for different outputs. </p>
