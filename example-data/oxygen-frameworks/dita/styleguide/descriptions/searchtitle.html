      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;searchtitle&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;searchtitle&gt;</code> element is used to specify a title that should be
         displayed by search tools that locate the topic. This is most useful when the topic has a
         title that makes sense in the context of a single information set, but may be too general
         in a list of search results; for example, a topic title of "Markup example" may make sense
         as part of a guide to DITA, but when found among thousands of unrelated topics, a search
         title of "DITA markup example" is more useful. </p>
