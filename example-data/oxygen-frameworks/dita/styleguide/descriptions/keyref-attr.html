      <p>The keyref attribute provides an indirect, late-bound reference to topics, to collections
         of topics (ditabase), to maps, to referenceable portions of maps, to non-DITA documents, to
         external URIs, or to XML content contained within a key definition topic reference. When
         the DITA content is processed, the key references are resolved using key definitions from
         DITA maps.</p>
