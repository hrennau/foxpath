      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;refbodydiv&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;refbodydiv&gt;</code> element is similar to the <code>&lt;bodydiv&gt;</code>
         element in that it provides an informal container for content that may be grouped within a
         reference. Reference topics place many restrictions on their content compared to generic
         topics; the <code>&lt;refbodydiv&gt;</code> element maintains these restrictions by only
         allowing elements that are already available within the body of a reference. There are no
         additional semantics attached to the <code>&lt;refbodydiv&gt;</code> element; it is purely
         a grouping element provided to help organize content. </p>
