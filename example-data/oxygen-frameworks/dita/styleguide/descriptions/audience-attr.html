   <body>
      <p>Indicates the intended audience for the
         element. This is a property attribute which supports conditional processing for filtering
         or flagging. If no value is specified, but the attribute is specified on an ancestor within
         a map or within the related-links section, the value will cascade from the closest
         ancestor. The attribute takes a space-delimited set of values. </p>
