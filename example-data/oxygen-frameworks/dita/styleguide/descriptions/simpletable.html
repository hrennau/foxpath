      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;simpletable&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;simpletable&gt;</code> element is used for tables that are regular in
         structure and do not need a caption. Choose the <code>&lt;simpletable&gt;</code> element
         when you want to show information in regular rows and columns. For example, multi-column
         tabular data such as phone directory listings or parts lists are good candidates for
            <code>&lt;simpletable&gt;</code>. Another good use of <code>&lt;simpletable&gt;</code>
         is for information that seems to beg for a three-part definition list; the
            <code>@keycol</code> attribute may be used to indicate which column represents the "key"
         or term-like column of your structure. </p>
