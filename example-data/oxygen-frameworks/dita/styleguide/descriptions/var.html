      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;var&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;var&gt;</code> element defines a variable within a syntax diagram for which
         the user must supply content, such as their user name or password. Processors typically
         represent the <code>&lt;var&gt;</code> element in output in an italic font, but are not
         required to do so. This element is part of the DITA programming domain, a special set of
         DITA elements designed to document programming tasks, concepts, and reference
         information.</p>
