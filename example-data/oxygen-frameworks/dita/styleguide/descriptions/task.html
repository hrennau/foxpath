      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;task&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;task&gt;</code> element is the top-level element for a task topic. Tasks are
         the main building blocks for task-oriented user assistance. They generally provide
         step-by-step instructions that will enable a user to perform a task. A task answers the
         question of "how to?" by telling the user precisely what to do and the order in which to do
         it. Tasks have the same high-level structure as other topics, with a title, short
         description and body. </p>
