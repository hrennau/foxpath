      <p>The <code>&lt;substeps&gt;</code> element allows you to break a step down into a series of
         separate actions, and should be used only if necessary. Try to describe the steps of a task
         in a single level of steps. If you need to use more than one level of
            <code>&lt;substep&gt;</code> nesting, you should probably rewrite the task to simplify
         it. </p>
