      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;stepresult&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;stepresult&gt;</code> element provides information on the expected outcome of
         a step. If a user interface is being documented, the outcome could describe a dialog box
         opening or the appearance of a progress indicator. Step results are useful to assure a user
         that they are on track, but should not be used for every step as this quickly becomes
         tedious. </p>
