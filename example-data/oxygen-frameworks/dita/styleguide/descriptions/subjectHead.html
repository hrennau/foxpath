      <p>The <code>&lt;subjectHead&gt;</code> element provides a heading for a group of subjects,
         for use if the scheme is displayed. For instance, a scheme may be displayed to let a user
         select subjects as part of faceted browsing. The <code>&lt;subjectHead&gt;</code> element
         itself does not reference a file and cannot be referenced as a key, so it does not define
         any controlled values. </p>
