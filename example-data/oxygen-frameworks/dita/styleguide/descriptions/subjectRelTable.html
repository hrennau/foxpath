      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;subjectRelTable&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;subjectRelTable&gt;</code> element is a specialized relationship table which
         establishes relationships between the subjects in different columns of the same row. This
         element provides an efficient way to author non-hierarchical relationships between
         subjects. Tools (such as search tools) that use subject relationships to find related
         content may use these associative relationships in a similar way to the hierarchical
         relationships. </p>
