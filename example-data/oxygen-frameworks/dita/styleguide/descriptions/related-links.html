      <p>The related information links of a topic (<code>&lt;related-links&gt;</code> element) are
         stored in a special section following the body of the topic. After a topic is processed
         into its final output form, the related links are usually displayed at the end of the
         topic, although some Web-based help systems might display them in a separate navigation
         frame. </p>
