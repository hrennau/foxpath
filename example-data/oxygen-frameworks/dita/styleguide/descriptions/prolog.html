      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;prolog&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;prolog&gt;</code> element contains information about the topic as an whole
         (for example, author information or subject category) that is either entered by the author
         or maintained by a software application. Much of the metadata inside the
            <code>&lt;prolog&gt;</code> will not be displayed with the topic when the topic is
         rendered, but may be used by processes that generate search indexes or customize
         navigation. </p>
