      <p>The element <code>&lt;lcTrueFalse&gt;</code> was deprecated in DITA version 1.3. It was
         replaced with the <code>&lt;lcTrueFalse2&gt;</code> element. It was originally intended to
         present the learner with two choices, one correct, the other incorrect, often presented as
         true/false or yes/no responses. </p>
