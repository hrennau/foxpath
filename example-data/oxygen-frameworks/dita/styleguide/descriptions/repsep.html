      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;repsep&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;repsep&gt;</code> element provides a repeat separator character within a
         syntax diagram to indicate that a group of syntax elements can (or should) be repeated. If
         the <code>&lt;repsep&gt;</code> element contains a separator character such as a plus (+),
         this indicates that the character must be used between repetitions of the syntax elements.
         This element is part of the DITA programming domain, a special set of DITA elements
         designed to document programming tasks, concepts, and reference information.</p>
