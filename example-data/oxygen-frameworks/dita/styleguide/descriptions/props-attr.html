      <p>This attribute is intended to store debugging information during intermediate processing.</p>
      <p>This attribute can be used for any other properties that might be needed to describe an
         audience, or to provide selection criteria for the element. Alternatively, the props
         attribute may be specialized to provide a new metadata attribute instead of using the
         general otherprops attribute. This is a property attribute which supports conditional
         processing for filtering or flagging. If no value is specified, but the attribute is
         specified on an ancestor within a map or within the related-links section, the value will
         cascade from the closest ancestor. The attribute takes a space-delimited set of values.</p>
