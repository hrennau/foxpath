   <body><p> In most situations, specifies whether a duplicate version of the topic is created when
         it is transformed. This duplicate version can be either literal or virtual. The value of
         the @copy-to attribute specifies the uniform resource identifier (URI) by which the topic
         can be referenced by a @conref attribute, &lt;topicref> element, or &lt;xref> element. The
         duplication is a convenience for output processors that use the URI of the topic to
         generate the base address of the output. The @keys and @keyref attributes provide an
         alternative mechanism; they enable references to topics in specific-use contexts without
         making copies.</p>
      <p>The @copy-to attribute also can be used to specify the name of a new chunk when topics are
         being chunked; it also can be used to determine the name of the stub topic that is
         generated from a &lt;topicref> element that contains a title but does not specify a target.
         In both of those cases, no duplicate version of the topic is generated. </p><p>For
         information on how the @copy-to attribute can be used with the @chunk attribute, see <a
            href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/dita/v1.2/os/spec/archSpec/chunking.html">Chunking</a>.
