      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;sub&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;sub&gt;</code> element indicates that text should appear with subscript
         highlighting, or placed lower in relationship to the surrounding text. Subscripted text is
         often a smaller font than the surrounding text. Formatting may vary depending on your
         output process. This element is part of the highlighting domain. Use this element only when
         a more semantically appropriate element is not available.</p>
