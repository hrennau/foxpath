      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;topicref&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;topicref&gt;</code> element identifies a topic (such as a concept, task, or
         reference) or other resource. A <code>&lt;topicref&gt;</code> can contain other
            <code>&lt;topicref&gt;</code> elements, allowing you to express navigation or
         table-of-contents hierarchies, as well as implying relationships between a containing
         (parent) <code>&lt;topicref&gt;</code> and its children. You can set the collection type of
         a parent <code>&lt;topicref&gt;</code> to determine how its children are related to each
         other. You can also express relationships among <code>&lt;topicref&gt;</code> elements by
         using group and table structures (such as <code>&lt;topicgroup&gt;</code> and
            <code>&lt;reltable&gt;</code>). Relationships are expressed as links in the output; by
         default, each participant in a relationship has links to the other participants in that
         relationship. </p>
