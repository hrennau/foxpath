      <p>This attribute must not be edited directly.</p>
      <p>The class attribute supports specialization. Its predefined values allow DITA tools to work
         correctly with ranges of related content. In a generalized DITA document the class
         attribute value in the generalized instance may differ from the default value for the class
         attribute for the element as given in the DTD or schema.</p>
