      <p>Allow an image to be scaled to fit within available space. If, for a given image, any one
         of height, width, or scale is specified, those attributes determine the graphic size, and
         any setting of scalefit is ignored. If none of those attributes are specified and
         scalefit="yes", then the image is scaled (the same factor in both dimensions) so that the
         graphic will just fit within the available height or width (whichever is more
         constraining). The available width would be the prevailing column (or table cell)
         width--that is, the width a paragraph of text would have if the graphic were a paragraph
         instead. The available height is implementation dependent, but if feasible, it is suggested
         to be the page (or table cell) height or some other reasonable value. </p>
