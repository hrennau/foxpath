      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;no-topic-nesting&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;no-topic-nesting&gt;</code> element is a placeholder in the DITA
         architecture. It is not actually used by the default DITA document types; it is for use
         only when creating a validly customized document type where the information designer wants
         to eliminate the ability to nest topics. Not intended for use by authors, and has no
         associated output processing. </p>
