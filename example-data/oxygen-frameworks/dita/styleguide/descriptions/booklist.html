      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;booklist&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;booklist&gt;</code> element is a general purpose element, designed for use in
         specializations, that references a topic or map containing a list of items within the book.
         For example, it could be used to reference a topic that contains a list of authors for the
         book. When a more specific element is already available, such as
            <code>&lt;tablelist&gt;</code> for a list of tables, that element should be used
         instead. </p>
