      <p>Indicates operating system and hardware. This is a property attribute which supports
         conditional processing for filtering or flagging. If no value is specified, but the
         attribute is specified on an ancestor within a map or within the related-links section, the
         value will cascade from the closest ancestor. The attribute takes a space-delimited set of
         values.</p>
