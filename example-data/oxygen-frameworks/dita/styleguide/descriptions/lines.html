      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;lines&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;lines&gt;</code> element contains text where line breaks are significant but
         white space is not. It can be used to represent dialogs, poetry, or other text fragments
         where line breaks are significant. The <code>&lt;lines&gt;</code> element is similar to
            <code>&lt;pre&gt;</code> in that line breaks are preserved, but the font style is not
         typically set to monospace, and extra spaces inside the lines are not preserved. </p>
