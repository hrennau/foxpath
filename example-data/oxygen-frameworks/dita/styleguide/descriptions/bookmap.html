      <p>The <code>&lt;bookmap&gt;</code> element is a map specialization used to describe the
         relationships among a set of DITA topics intended to be configured as a traditional book.
         Bookmaps consist of references to topics organized as book content. The topic references
         therefore are labeled according to the book components they point to, such as book title,
         front matter, chapter, and appendix. </p>
