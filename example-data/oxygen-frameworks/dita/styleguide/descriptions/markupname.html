      <p>Use the <code>&lt;markupname&gt;</code> element to identify mentions of named markup
         tokens, such as elements or attributes in XML or SGML, named groups in XSD schemas, or
         named patterns in RELAX NG schemas. This element also serves as the specialization basis
         for the elements in the XML mention domain; when that domain is present, its more specific
         elements should be used instead of <code>&lt;markupname&gt;</code> when appropriate. </p>
