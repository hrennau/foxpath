      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;lcQuestionBase&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;lcQuestionBase&gt;</code> element was deprecated in DITA version 1.3. It was
         replaced with the <code>&lt;lcQuestionBase2&gt;</code> element. It was originally intended
         as the base for lcQuestion in the learningDomain domain. This is an "abstract" element type
         intended only for use as a base for specialization. </p>
