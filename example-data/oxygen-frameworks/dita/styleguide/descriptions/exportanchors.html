      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;exportanchors&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;exportanchors&gt;</code> element is used to delay <code>@conref</code>
         resolution within DITA documents. This allows you to process or display DITA content in a
         way that will resolve only some of the <code>@conref</code> values in that content, while
         remaining values are left for later resolution. The element contains a list of IDs or keys
         that should not be resolved during the initial preparation of the content for display;
         those IDs and keys will be preserved after that preparation, as will the conref
         relationship itself. </p>
