      <h1 id="ariaid-title1"><code>&lt;hasNarrower&gt;</code></h1>
      <p>For subjects within the <code>&lt;hasNarrower&gt;</code> element, the container subject is
         more general than each of the contained subjects. That is, this element makes the default
         hierarchical relationship explicit, although the way in which a relationship is narrower is
         not specified. </p>
