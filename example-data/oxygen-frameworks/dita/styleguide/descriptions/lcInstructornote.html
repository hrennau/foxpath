		<p>The <code>&lt;lcInstructornote&gt;</code> was deprecated in DITA version 1.3. It was
			replaced with the <code>&lt;lcInstructornote2&gt;</code> element. It was originally
			intended to provide information or notes you want to provide to the course instructor.
			These notes can be conditionalized out of content you intend to deliver to the learner. </p>
