      <p>The <code>&lt;fig&gt;</code> element is a figure (sometimes called an "exhibit") with an
         optional title for a wide variety of content. A figure commonly contains an image or
         artwork, but it can contain several kinds of text objects as well. A title is placed inside
         the figure to provide a caption that describes the content. </p>
