      <p>Contains the name of the product to which the element applies. This is a property attribute
         which supports conditional processing for filtering or flagging. If no value is specified,
         but the attribute is specified on an ancestor within a map or within the related-links
         section, the value will cascade from the closest ancestor. The attribute takes a
         space-delimited set of values.</p>
