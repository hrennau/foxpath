      <p>A keys attribute consists of one or more space-separated keys. Map authors define keys
         using a topicref or topicref specialization that contains the “keys” attribute. Each key
         definition introduces a global identifier for a resource referenced from a map. Keys
         resolve to the resources given as the href value on the key definition topicref element, to
         content contained within the key definition topicref element, or both.</p>
