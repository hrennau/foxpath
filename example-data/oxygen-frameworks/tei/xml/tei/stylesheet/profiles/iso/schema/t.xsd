      <xs:documentation>Contains information of an administrative nature for the node (parent element)
					in question, such as the source of information, or the project or client for
					which it applies. The type of administrative information is indicated by the
					value of the type attribute. It can appear alone, or, if additional
					information needs to be provided, such as a note or a reference, it can be
					nested in an adminGrp element. This element can occur at any of
						the three levels of the terminological entry. Several types, however,
						logically should occur at restricted levels, as indicated with the
						corresponding data-category descriptions. For instance,
						databaseType and conceptOrigin would typically occur
						at the termEntry level. Care should be taken to insert the admin at
						the appropriate level of the entry according to its type attribute value and
						the parent node to which the administrative information applies.

									form. It may be coupled with a target attribute to
									point to the full or expanded form. Normally both the short form
									and the full form will be contained in the same entry, but each

										United States of America: United States of

									and its full form indicates which term in a terminological entry
									is the full form of the short form.
