are transferred over).

5) For all of these attributes, each value within them (separated by a
space) should be preceded by a hash mark ("#"):

ana|active|adj|adjFrom|adjTo|children|children|class|code|code|copyOf|corresp|decls|domains|end|exclude|fVal|feats|follow|from|hand|inst|langKey|location|mergedin|new|next|old|origin|otherLangs|parent|passive|perf|prev|render|resp|sameAs|scheme|script|select|since|start|synch|target|targetEnd|to|to|value|value|who|wit

<figure><graphic>URI attr. value</graphic>...(transfer over any other
content already in figure here)...</figure>

    <choice><corr>...(Former text inside of corr goes
   here)...</corr><sic>...(value of the "sic" attribute now goes here
   instead)...</sic></choice>

15) Every <sic> with a "corr" attribute should be:
   <choice><corr>...(Value of the corr attribute goes
   here)...</corr><sic>...(text inside of <sic> now goes here
   instead)...</sic></choice>

16) Every <abbr> with a "expan" attribute or <expan> with an "abbr"

   a) <date>'s value should be added as a "when" attribute to the
   enclosing <change> .

   b) any <resp> inside of <respStmt> inside of <change> should be
   changed to the "who" attribute of the enclosing <change>

   directly inside <change>
