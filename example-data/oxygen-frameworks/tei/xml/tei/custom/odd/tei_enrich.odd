<div><head>Introduction</head>

<p>This document defines an XML format for the structure of the data
which all ENRICH partners will contribute to the Manuscriptorium,
either directly or indirectly by means of a harvester or
transformation process. The schema is a conformant subset of Release 1.1.0
of TEI P5. </p>

<p>The schema defined by this document addresses three distinct
aspects of a digitized manuscript:
<list rend="ordered">
<item>metadata describing the original source manuscript (<ptr
target="#msdesc"/>) </item>
<item>metadata describing digitized images of the original source
manuscript (<ptr target="#facs"/>) </item>
<item>a transcription of the text contained by the original source
manuscript <!--(<ptr target="#transcr"/>) --></item>
</list></p>

<p>Within Manuscriptorium, only the first two are required. However,
the schema documented here also provides for the third, in the
interest of completeness and for the assistance of ENRICH partners
wishing to provide richer access facilities to  their holdings. </p>

<p>The schema defined by this document is available in DTD, RELAX NG,
and W3C Schema languages, downloadable from the address <ptr
target="http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ENRICH/ODD/RomaResults/"/>. A PDF
version of the present document (300 pages) is also available from 
<ptr
target="http://tei.oucs.ox.ac.uk/ENRICH/Deliverables/referenceManual.pdf"/>;
this forms one of the key deliverables for Work Package 3 of the ENRICH project. </p>


<p>The MASTER and MASTER-X specifications both defined comparatively
unconstrained XML formats, which permitted a very wide range of
possibilities and did not attempt to constrain (for example)
values to any predefined set of values. While appropriate for an
interchange format, this approach has some drawbacks. 
<list>
<item>there may be wide variation in approaches taken to represent
essentially the same phenomenon (e.g.)</item>
<item>the format appears over complex to novice users, who will only
ever want to use a very small subset of the possible tags</item>
<item>developing software (e.g. stylesheets) for the format becomes
unnecessarily complex, since every possibility must be allowed for
even though it is unlikely to appear</item>
<item>accurate searching of the data may be needlessly complicated by
the large number of ways of representing e.g. attribute values such as
dates</item>
</list>
</p>
<p>In the ENRICH schema  the number of choices
and the possible values of several attributes to have been
considerably constrained. Nevertheless, 
<list>
<item>the resulting schema  remains fully  TEI Conformant: we are only
defining a subset</item>
<item>all constraints introduced have the full consent of all
partners in the project</item>
</list></p>

<p>The overall structure of an ENRICH-conformant XML document may be
summarized as follows:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" >
<TEI >
<teiHeader>
<!-- ... metadata describing the manuscript  -->
</teiHeader>
<facsimile>
<!-- ... metadata describing the digital images -->
</facsimile>
<text>
<!-- (optional) transcription of the manuscript -->
</text>
</TEI>

</egXML>

</p>

<p>The remainder of this document describes each of these aspects in
more detail, using material derived from the P5 release of the TEI
Guidelines.</p>

</div>

<div type="div2" xml:id="msdesc">

<head>Manuscript Description Metadata</head>

<p>Each distinct manuscript must be described using a distinct
TEI-conformant <gi>teiHeader</gi> element, as specified in the <ref
target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html">TEI
Guidelines, chapter 2</ref>. This
element may contain many components, depending on the needs of the
creator, which may be provided in either structured or (relatively)
unstructured form. For Manuscriptorium purposes, the following
components of the TEI Header <emph>must</emph> be provided, and
<emph>must</emph> conform to the constraints specified here.
<specList>
<specDesc key="fileDesc"/>
<specDesc key="titleStmt"/>
<specDesc key="publicationStmt"/>
<specDesc key="sourceDesc"/>
<specDesc key="revisionDesc"/>
</specList>
</p>

<p>Other header components, if present, will be ignored by
Manuscriptorium; they will be retained for storage in the system and
returned on request, but their content is not processed for any
purpose, including access.</p>



<p>The following example shows the minimal required structure:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" >
<teiHeader>
<fileDesc>
<titleStmt>
<title>[Title of manuscript]</title>
</titleStmt>
<publicationStmt>
<distributor>[name of data provider]</distributor>
<idno>[project-specific identifier]</idno>
</publicationStmt>
<sourceDesc>
<msDesc xml:id="ex5" xml:lang="en"> <!-- [full manuscript description ]--></msDesc>
</sourceDesc>
</fileDesc>
<revisionDesc>
<change when="2008-01-01">
  <!--  [revision information] -->
</change>
</revisionDesc>
</teiHeader>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Taking these in turn,
<list>

<item>the title of the manuscript is used to identify it in short
summary displays; it should correspond with the information used for
the same purpose in the <gi>head</gi> element within the
<gi>msDesc</gi> element below.</item>

<item>the name of the data provider may be given in any conventional
form but should be consistent across all data provided.</item>

<item>the project-specific identifier has two parts: it consists of
the short alphabetic code used to identify the partner (e.g. OCS for
OUCS), followed by a four digit sequence number. For example,
<code>OCS0002</code> would be the second digital record contributed to
the Manuscriptorium project by partner OCS. Note that this identifier
has nothing to do with the manuscript shelfmark or other
identifier. When ingesting records, Manuscriptorium will assume that
if a record with this identifier already exists, the intention is to
replace it.</item>

<item>the manuscript description provided must follow the
specification given in the remainder of this section.</item>

<item>at least one <gi>change</gi> element must be provided, providing
the date that this record was last revised before being submitted. As
elsewhere, dates must be provided in the ISO format
<code>yyyy-mm-dd</code>. The content of the <gi>change</gi> element
is free text, which may be used to indicate the scope of any revision
and the person/s responsible for it. </item>
</list>
</p>

<p>
<specList>
<specDesc key="msDesc" atts="xml:id xml:lang"/>
</specList>
 
The <gi>msDesc</gi> element is used to provide detailed information
about a single manuscript. For ENRICH purposes, this must carry the
attributes mentioned above, to supply a unique internal identifier for the
manuscript, and to specify the language of its description
respectively. </p>
<p>The value for <att>xml:id</att> may be the same as the value
supplied for the <gi>idno</gi> element in the <gi>teiHeader</gi>, or
it may be some other project-specific identifier used for
cross-reference. It should however be prefixed by an identifier for
the partner concerned, so as to avoid possible identifier
collisions. </p>
<p>The value for <att>xml:lang</att>, as elsewhere, must be supplied
in the form of a valid language identifier (see below). If no value is
supplied, the assumption is that the language of the description is
English.</p>
<p>The <gi>msDesc</gi> element  has the following component elements,
each of which is further described in the
remainder of this section. 
<specList>
<specDesc key="msIdentifier"/>
<specDesc key="msContents"/>
<specDesc key="physDesc"/>
<specDesc key="history"/>
<specDesc key="additional"/>
<specDesc key="msPart"/>
</specList></p>

<p>The first of these components, <gi>msIdentifier</gi>, is mandatory;
it is described in more detail in <ptr target="#msid"/> below. It is
followed by either one or more paragraphs, marked up as a series of
<gi>p</gi> elements, or one or more of the specialized elements
<gi>msContents</gi> (<ptr target="#msco"/>), <gi>physDesc</gi> (<ptr
target="#msph"/>), <gi>history</gi> (<ptr target="#mshy"/>), and
<gi>additional</gi> (<ptr target="#msad"/>).  These elements are all
optional, but if used they must appear in the order given here.
Finally, in the case of a composite manuscript, a full description may
also contain one or more <gi>msPart</gi> elements (<ptr
target="#mspt"/>).</p>


<p>To demonstrate the variety of records which may be produced,
consider the following sample manuscript description, chosen more or
less at random from the Bodleian Library's <title level="m">Summary
catalogue</title>
<figure >
<graphic width="450px" url="images/MSadda61.png"/>
<head>Entry for Bodleian MS. Add. A. 61 in Madan et al.
    1895-1953</head>
</figure>
</p>

<p>The simplest way of digitizing this catalogue entry would simply be
to key in the text, tagging the relevant parts of it which make up
the mandatory <gi>msIdentifier</gi> element, as follows:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" >
<msDesc xml:id="ex4" xml:lang="en">
<msIdentifier>
<settlement>Oxford</settlement>
<repository>Bodleian Library</repository>
<idno>MS. Add. A. 61</idno>
<altIdentifier type="former"><idno>28843</idno></altIdentifier>
</msIdentifier>
<p>In Latin, on parchment: written in more than one hand of the 13th
cent. in England: 7¼ x 5⅜ in., i + 55 leaves, in double columns: with
a few coloured capitals.</p>
<p>'Hic incipit Bruitus Anglie,' the De origine et gestis Regum
Angliae of Geoffrey of Monmouth (Galfridus Monumetensis: beg. 'Cum
mecum multa &amp; de multis.'</p>
<p>On fol. 54v very faint is 'Iste liber est fratris guillelmi de
buria de ... Roberti ordinis fratrum Pred[icatorum],' 14th cent. (?):
'hanauilla' is written at the foot of the page (15th cent.).  Bought
from the rev. W. D. Macray on March 17, 1863, for £1 10s.</p>
</msDesc></egXML>
With a suitable stylesheet, this encoding would be as readable as the
original; it would not, however, be very useful for search purposes
since only shelfmarks and other identifiers are distinguished by the markup. To
improve on this, one might wrap the paragraphs in the appropriate
special-purpose first-child-level elements of <gi>msDesc</gi> and use
some additional phrase-level elements:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples" >
<msDesc xml:id="ex1" xml:lang="en">
<msIdentifier>
 <settlement>Oxford</settlement>
 <repository>Bodleian Library</repository>

 <altIdentifier type="former">

</msIdentifier>
<msContents>

   (15th cent.). Bought from the rev. W. D. Macray on March 17, 1863, for
   £1 10s.</p>
</history>
   </msDesc>
</egXML>
Such an encoding allows the user to search for such features as title,
material, and date and place of origin; it is also possible to
distinguish quoted material and Latin material from descriptive
passages and to search within distinct parts of the description, for
example, the manuscript history as distinct from its materials.</p>
        
<p>This process could be continued further, restructuring the whole
entry so as to take full advantage of many more  encoding
possibilities:

<head>Phrase-level Elements</head>
<p>Phrase-level elements are XML elements that can appear at the same
hierarchic level as text in many parts of the digital
record. Some of these are specialized, in that they may be used only
within particular contexts; others may be used in any context (see <ptr target="#globalphrase"/>).

Within the components of the <gi>msDesc</gi> element, the
following specialized phrase level elements are available:

<specList>
<specDesc key="catchwords"/>
<specDesc key="dimensions"/>
<specDesc key="heraldry"/>
<specDesc key="locus"/>
<specDesc key="material"/>
<specDesc key="watermark"/>
<specDesc key="origDate"/>
<specDesc key="origPlace"/>
<specDesc key="secFol"/>
<specDesc key="signatures"/>
</specList></p>

<div type="div3" xml:id="msdates">
<head>Origination</head>
<p>The following elements may be used to provide information about the
origins of any aspect of a manuscript:
<specList><specDesc key="origDate"/>
<specDesc key="origPlace"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>origDate</gi> and <gi>origPlace</gi> elements are
used to indicate  the date and
place of origin of a manuscript or manuscript part. Such information
will usually appear  within the <gi>history</gi> element,
discussed in section <ptr target="#mshy"/>, but can also appear within
other parts of the  manuscript description, such as its decoration or
binding, when these are not of the same date as the manuscript
itself. Both these elements are members of the
<ident type="class">att.editLike</ident> class, from which they inherit the
following attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="att.editLike" atts="cert resp evidence"/></specList></p>
<p>The <gi>origDate</gi> element is a member of the <ident
type="class">att.datable</ident> class, and may thus also carry the
following attributes: <specList><specDesc
key="att.datable.w3c" atts="notBefore notAfter when from to"/></specList></p>

</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msmat">
<head>Material</head>
<p>The <gi>material</gi> element can be used to tag any specific term
used for the physical material of which a manuscript (or binding, seal, etc.)
is composed.
<specList>
<specDesc key="material"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The element may appear wherever a term regarded as significant by
the encoder occurs, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<binding>
<p>Brown <material>calfskin</material>, previously with two clasps.</p>
</binding>
</egXML>

</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="mswat"><head>Watermarks and Stamps</head>
<p>Two further elements are provided to
mark up other decorative features characteristic of manuscript leaves and
bindings:
<specList>
<specDesc key="watermark"/>
<specDesc key="stamp"/>
</specList></p>
<p>These elements may appear
wherever a term regarded as significant by the encoder occurs. The
<gi>watermark</gi> element is most likely to be of use within the
<gi>support</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#msph1sup"/>
below. We give a simple example here: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><support><material>Rag
paper</material> with <watermark>anchor</watermark>
watermark</support></egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>stamp</gi> element will typically appear when text from the source
is being transcribed, for example within a rubric in the following case:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><rubric>Apologyticu TTVLLIANI AC IGNORATIA IN XPO IHV<lb/>
SI NON LICET<lb/>
NOBIS RO<lb/>
manii imperii <stamp>Bodleian stamp</stamp><lb/></rubric></egXML>
</p>
<p>It may also appear as part of the detailed description of a binding:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<binding><p>Modern calf recasing with original armorial stamp <stamp>Ex
Bibliotheca J. Richard D.M.</stamp></p></binding>
</egXML>
</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msdim">
<head>Dimensions</head>
<p>The <gi>dimensions</gi> element can be used to specify the size of
some aspect of the manuscript.
<specList>
<specDesc key="dimensions" atts="type"/>
</specList></p>

<p>The <gi>dimensions</gi> element will normally occur within the
element describing the particular feature or aspect of a manuscript
whose dimensions are being given; thus the size of the leaves would be
specified within the <gi>support</gi> or <gi>extent</gi> element (part
of the <gi>physDesc</gi> element discussed in <ptr target="#msph1"/>),
while the dimensions of other specific parts of a manuscript, such as
accompanying materials, binding, etc., would be given in other parts
of the description, as appropriate. </p>
<p>The <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>dimensions</gi> element is
used to specify more exactly the item being measured. For ENRICH
purposes, this attribute must take one of the following values:
<val>leaf</val>,
<val>binding</val>,
<val>slip</val>,
<val>written</val>,
<val>boxed</val>. </p>
<p>The following three elements are available within the <gi>dimensions</gi> element:
<specList>
<specDesc key="height"/>
<specDesc key="width"/>
<specDesc key="depth"/>
</specList>
Each of these elements, if present, must be given in the order
specified.</p>
<p>These three elements, as well as <gi>dimensions</gi> itself, are
all members of the <ident type="class">att.dimensions</ident> class,
and thus all carry the following attributes: <specList><specDesc
key="att.dimensions" atts="extent unit quantity atLeast atMost min max scope">
</specDesc></specList></p>
<p>Attributes <att>min</att>,  <att>max</att>, and <att>scope</att> are used only when the
measurement applies to several items, for example the size of many or
all the leaves in a manuscript; attributes <att>atLeast</att> and
<att>atMost</att> are used when the measurement applies to a single
item, for example the size of a  specific codex,  but has had to be
estimated. Attribute <gi>quantity</gi> is used when the measurement
can be given exactly, and applies to a single item; this is the usual
situation.  The units in which dimensions are measured should always
be specified using the <att>unit</att> attribute, which will normally
be taken from a closed set of values appropriate to the project, using
standard units of measurement wherever possible. In the ENRICH project
the  following values are permitted:
<val>cm</val>, 
<val>mm</val>,
<val>in</val>,
<val>line</val>,
<val>char</val>. If the only data available for the measurement uses
some other unit, or it is preferred to normalize it in some other way,
then it may be supplied as a string value using the
<att>extent</att> attribute.
</p>
<p>The content of these elements, if present, simply copies the way
that the measurement is presented in some source text; it may be
omitted.
</p>
<p>In the simplest case, only the <att>extent</att> attribute may be
supplied: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><width
extent="6 cubit">six cubits</width></egXML> 
More usually, the measurement will be normalised into a value 
and an appropriate SI unit: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><width quantity="270" unit="cm">six cubits</width></egXML>
Where the exact value is uncertain, the attributes <att>atLeast</att>
and <att>atMost</att> may be used to indicate the upper and lower
bounds of an estimated value:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><width atLeast="250"
						       atMost="300" unit="cm">six cubits</width></egXML>
</p>

<p>It is often convenient to supply a measurement which applies to a
number of discrete observations: for example, the number of ruled
lines on the pages of a manuscript (which may not all be the same), or
the diameter of an object like a bell, which will differ depending
where it is measured. In such cases, the <att>scope</att> attribute
may be used to specify the observations for which this measurement is
applicable:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><height unit="lines"
							scope="most"
							atLeast="20"/>
</egXML>
This indicates that most pages have at least 20 lines. The attributes
<att>min</att> and <att>max</att> can also be used to specify the possible
range of values: for example, to show that  all pages have between 12 
and 30 lines: 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><height unit="lines"
scope="all" min="12" max="30"/>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>The <gi>dimensions</gi> element may be repeated as often as
necessary, with appropriate attribute values to indicate the nature
and scope of the measurement concerned. For example, in the following
case the leaf size and ruled space of the leaves of the manuscript are
specified:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<dimensions type="written" unit="mm">
 <height scope="most"  quantity="90" unit="mm"/>
 <width scope="most" quantity="48" unit="mm"/>
</dimensions>
<dimensions type="leaf">
 <height min="157" max="160" unit="mm"/>
 <width quantity="105" unit="mm"/>
</dimensions>
</egXML>
This indicates that for most leaves of the manuscript being described
the ruled space is 90 mm high and 48 mm wide, while the leaves throughout 
are between 157 and 160 mm in height and 105 mm in width.</p>

</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msloc"><head>References to Locations within a Manuscript</head>
<p>The <gi>locus</gi> element is a specialized form of the <gi>ref</gi> element.
<specList>
<specDesc key="locus" atts="from to scheme"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>locus</gi> element is used to specify the location in the
manuscript occupied by the element within which it appears. It should
be supplied  as the first component of an <gi>msItem</gi> element, or of any of the more specific elements appearing within one
(see further section <ptr target="#msco"/> below, in order to  specify the location of that item within the manuscript being
described.</p>
<p>A <gi>locus</gi> element can be used to identify any reference to
one or more folios within a manuscript, wherever such a reference is
appropriate. Locations are conventionally specified as a sequence of
folio or page numbers, but may also be a discontinuous list, or a
combination of the two. This specification should be given as the
content of the <gi>locus</gi> element, using the conventions
appropriate to the individual scholar or holding institution, as in
the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msItem n="1"><locus>ff. 1-24r</locus>
<title>Apocalypsis beati Ioannis Apostoli</title>
</msItem>
</egXML></p>
<p>A normalized form of the location can also be
supplied, using special purpose attributes on the <gi>locus</gi>
element, as in the following revision of the above example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msItem n="1"><locus from="1r" to="24r">ff. 1-24r</locus>
<title>Apocalypsis beati Ioannis Apostoli</title>
</msItem>
</egXML></p>
<p>If a digital image is available for the locus described by the
<gi>locus</gi> element, then the  <att>facs</att> attribute should be
used  to  associate it
with that  image, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<decoDesc>
<p>Several of the miniatures in this section have been damaged and 
overpainted at a later date (e.g. the figure of Christ on 
<locus facs="#F33R">fol. 33r</locus>; the face of the 
Shepherdess on <locus facs="#F59V">fol. 59v</locus>, 
etc.).</p>
</decoDesc>
</egXML>
Usually, the <att>facs</att> attribute  points
directly to a <gi>surface</gi> element within the <gi>facsimile</gi>
element associated with the manuscript description, as further
discussed in section <ptr target="#facs"/> below. It is also possible,
but not recommended, to use this attribute to point to images of the
relevant pages held in some other external image archive.</p>

<p>Where a transcription of the relevant pages is also available, this
may be pointed to using the <att>target</att> attribute, as in the
following example:

	<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<!-- within ms description -->
            <msItem n="1">
              <locus target="#f1r #f1v #f2r">ff. 1r-2r</locus>
              <author>Ben Jonson</author>
              <title>Ode to himself</title>
              <rubric rend="italics">

              <incipit>Com leaue the loathed stage</incipit>

              <bibl><name type="person">Beal</name>, <title>Index 1450-1625</title>, JnB 380</bibl>
            </msItem>

	    <!-- within transcription ... -->
	    <pb xml:id="f1r"/>
	    <!-- ... -->
	    <pb xml:id="f1v"/>
	    <!-- ... -->
	    <pb xml:id="f2r"/>
	    <!-- ... -->
	</egXML>
</p>


<p>Where a manuscript contains more than one foliation, the
<att>scheme</att> attribute may be used to distinguish them. For
example, MS 65 Corpus Christi College, Cambridge contains two fly
leaves bearing music. These leaves have modern foliation 135 and
136 respectively, but are also marked with an older foliation. This
may be preserved in an encoding such as the following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<locus scheme="#original">XCIII</locus>
<locus scheme="#modern">135</locus>
</egXML> Here the <att>scheme</att> attribute points to a
<gi>foliation</gi> element providing more details about the scheme
used, as further discussed in <ptr target="#msphfo"/> below.</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msnames">
<head>Names of Persons, Places, and Organizations</head>
<p>The standard TEI element <gi>name</gi> may be used to identify
names of any kind occurring within a description:
<specList>
<specDesc key="name" atts="type"/>
</specList>
As further discussed in <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#CONARS"/>, this element is a member of
the TEI class <ident type="class">att.canonical</ident>, from which it
inherits the  following attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="att.canonical" atts="key ref"/></specList>
</p>
<p>Here are some examples of the use of the <gi>name</gi> element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<name type="person">Thomas Hoccleve</name>
<name type="place">Villingaholt</name>
<name type="org">Vetus Latina Institut</name>
<name type="person" ref="#HOC001">Occleve</name>
</egXML></p>
<p>Note that the <gi>name</gi> element is defined as providing
information about a <emph>name</emph>, not the person, place, or organization to which that name refers. In the last example above, the <att>ref</att> attribute is used to
associate the name with a more detailed description of the person
named. This is provided by means of the <gi>person</gi> element, which
is also available in the ENRICH schema. An element such as the following might then be used to provide
detailed information about the person indicated by the name:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<person xml:id="HOC001" sex="1">
<persName><surname>Hoccleve</surname>
<forename>Thomas</forename>
</persName>
<birth notBefore="1368"/>
<occupation>poet</occupation>
<!-- other personal data -->
</person></egXML>

<!--<specList>
<specDesc key="person"/>
</specList>-->
Note that an instance of the 
<gi>person</gi> element must be provided for each distinct
<att>ref</att> value specified. In the example above, the value
<val>HOC001</val> must be found as the <att>xml:id</att> attribute of
some <gi>person</gi>; the same
value will be used as the <att>ref</att> attribute of every reference
to Hoccleve in the document (however spelled), but there will only be
one <gi>person</gi> element with this identifier.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the <att>key</att> attribute may be used to supply
an identifying code for the person referenced by the name
independently of both the existence of  a <gi>person</gi> element and
the use of the standard URI reference mechanism. If, for example, a
project maintains as its authority file some non-digital resource, or
uses  a database which cannot readily be
integrated with other digital resources for this purpose, the unique
codes used by such <soCalled>offline</soCalled> resources may be used
as values for the <att>key</att> attribute. Although such practices clearly
reduce the interchangeability of the resulting encoded texts, they may
be judged more convenient or practical in certain situations.
</p>

<p>All the <gi>person</gi> elements referenced by a particular
document set should be collected together within a <gi>listPerson</gi>
<!-- need xref -->
element, located in the TEI Header. This functions as a kind
of prosopography for all the people referenced by the set of
manuscripts being described, in much the same way as a
<gi>listBibl</gi> element in the back matter may be used to hold
bibliographic information for all the works referenced.</p>

<p>Similar mechanisms are used to maintain and reference canonical
lists of places or organizations.</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msmisc">
<head>Catchwords, Signatures, Secundo Folio</head>
<p>The <gi>catchwords</gi> element is used to describe one method by
which correct ordering of the quires of a codex is ensured. Typically,
this takes the form of a word or phrase written in the lower margin of
the last leaf verso of a gathering, which provides a preview of the
first recto leaf of the successive gathering. This may be a simple
phrase such as the following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><catchwords>Quires signed on the last leaf verso in roman numerals.</catchwords>
</egXML>
Alternatively, it may contain more details:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<catchwords>Vertical catchwords in the hand of the scribe placed along 
the inner bounding line, reading from top to bottom.</catchwords>
</egXML></p>
<p>The <soCalled>Signatures</soCalled> element is used, in a similar
way, to describe a similar  system in which quires or leaves are
marked  progressively  in order to facilitate arrangement during
binding. For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><signatures>At the bottom of the first four leaves of quires 1-14 are 
  the remains of a series of quire signatures a-o plus roman figures in 
  a cursive hand of the fourteenth century.</signatures>
</egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>signatures</gi> element can be used for either leaf
signatures, or a combination of quire and leaf signatures, whether the
marking is alphabetic, alphanumeric, or some ad hoc system, as in the
following more complex example:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><signatures>Quire and leaf signatures in letters, [b]-v, and roman numerals; 
those in quires 10 (1) and 17 (s) in red ink and different from others; 
every third quire also signed with red crayon in arabic numerals in the 
centre lower margin of the first leaf recto: "2" for quire 4 (f. 19), 
"3" for quire 7 (f. 43); "4", barely visible, for quire 10 (f. 65), "5", 
in a later hand, for quire 13 (f. 89), "6", in a later hand, for quire 
16 (f. 113).</signatures>
</egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>secFol</gi> element (for <soCalled>secundo
folio</soCalled>) is used to record an identifying phrase (also
called <foreign>dictio probatoria</foreign>)  taken from a
specific known point in a codex (for example the first few words on
the second leaf). Since these words will differ from one copy of
a text to another, the practice originated in the middle ages of using
them when cataloguing a manuscript in order to distinguish individual
copies of a work in a way which its opening words could not.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

</egXML>
<!-- better example needed --></p></div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="mshera">
<head>Heraldry</head><!-- rename as armsDesc? -->
<p>Descriptions of heraldic arms, supporters, devices, and mottos may
appear at various points in the description of a manuscript, usually in the context of ownership
information, binding descriptions, or detailed accounts of
illustrations. A full description may also contain a detailed account of the
heraldic components of a manuscript independently considered. Frequently, however, heraldic descriptions will
be cited as short phrases within other parts of the record. The phrase
level element <gi>heraldry</gi> is provided to allow such phrases to
be marked for further  analysis, as in the following
examples:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<p>Ownership stamp (xvii cent.) on i recto with the arms <heraldry>A bull 
passant within a bordure bezanty, in chief a crescent for difference</heraldry>

</egXML></p>
</div>
</div>

<div type="div2" xml:id="msid">
<head>The Manuscript Identifier</head>
<p>The <gi>msIdentifier</gi> element is intended to provide an
unambiguous means of uniquely identifying a particular
manuscript. This may be done in a structured way, by providing
 information about the holding institution and the call number,
shelfmark, or other identifier used to indicate its location within
that institution. Alternatively, or in addition, a manuscript may be
identified simply by a commonly used name.
<specList>
<specDesc key="msIdentifier"/>
</specList></p>
<p>A manuscript's actual physical location may occasionally be
different from its place of ownership; at Cambridge University, for
example, manuscripts owned by various colleges are kept in the central
University Library. Normally, it is the ownership of the manuscript which should
be specified in the manuscript identifier, while additional or more
precise information on the physical location of the manuscript can be
given within the <gi>adminInfo</gi> element, discussed in section <ptr target="#msadad"/> below.</p>
<p>The following elements are available within <gi>msIdentifier</gi>
to identify the holding institution:
<specList>
<specDesc key="country"/>
<specDesc key="region"/>
<specDesc key="settlement"/>
<specDesc key="institution"/>
<specDesc key="repository"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Only one of each of the elements listed above
may appear within the <gi>msIdentifier</gi> and they must, if present,
appear in the order given.</p>
<note rend="query">Should we make country mandatory? </note>
<p>These elements are all also members of the  attribute class
<ident type="class">att.naming</ident>, from which they inherit the following
attribute:
<specList><specDesc key="att.naming"/></specList></p>
<p>The following elements are used within <gi>msIdentifier</gi> to
provide different ways of identifying the manuscript within its holding institution:
<specList>
<specDesc key="collection"/>
<specDesc key="idno"/>
<specDesc key="altIdentifier" atts="type"/>
<specDesc key="msName"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Major manuscript repositories will usually have a preferred
form of citation for manuscript shelfmarks, including rules
about punctuation, spacing, abbreviation, etc., which should be
adhered to. Where such a format also contains information which might
additionally be supplied as a distinct subcomponent of the
<gi>msIdentifier</gi>, for example a collection name,
a decision must be taken as to whether to use the more specific
element, or to include such information within the <gi>idno</gi> element. For
example, the manuscript formally identified as <q>El 26 C 0</q> forms
a part of the Ellesmere (<q>El</q>) collection. Either of the
following encodings is therefore feasible:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<country>USA</country>
<region type="state">California</region>
<settlement>San Marino</settlement>
<repository>Huntington Library</repository>
<collection>El</collection>
<idno>26 C 9</idno>
<msName>The Ellesmere Chaucer</msName>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML>
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<country>USA</country>
<region type="state">California</region>
<settlement>San Marino</settlement>
<repository>Huntington Library</repository>
<idno>El 26 C 9</idno>
<msName>The Ellesmere Chaucer</msName>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML></p>
<p>In the former example, the preferred form of the identifier can be
retrieved by prefixing the content of the <gi>idno</gi> element with
that of the  <gi>collection</gi> element, while in the latter it is
given explicitly. The advantage of the former is that it it simplifies
accurate retrieval of all manuscripts from a given collection; the
disadvantage is that encoded abbreviations of this kind may not be as
immediately comprehensible. Care should be taken to avoid redundancy:
for example <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<collection>El</collection>
<idno>El 26 C 9</idno>
</egXML> would clearly be inappropriate. Equally clearly, 
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<collection>Ellesmere</collection>
<idno>El 26 C 9</idno>
</egXML> might be considered helpful in some circumstances (if, for
example, some of the items in the Ellsemere collection had shelfmarks
which did not begin <q>El</q>)</p>
<p>In cases where the shelfmark  contains no information about the
collection, it may be necessary to provide this explicitly, as in
the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<country>USA</country>
<region type="state">New Jersey</region>
<settlement>Princeton</settlement>
<repository>Princeton University Library</repository>
<collection>Scheide Library</collection>
<idno>MS 71</idno>
<msName>Blickling Homiliary</msName>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML></p>
<p>In these examples, <gi>msName</gi> has been used to provide
a common name other than the shelfmark by which a manuscript is
known. Where a manuscript has several such names, more than one of these elements may be used, as in the following
example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<country>Danmark</country>
<settlement>København</settlement>
<repository>Det Arnamagnæanske Institut</repository>
<idno>AM 45 fol.</idno>
<msName xml:lang="la">Codex Frisianus</msName>
<msName xml:lang="is">Fríssbók</msName>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML>
Here the globally available <att>xml:lang</att> attribute has been
used to specify the language of the alternative names. <!--This is a
standard TEI facility, which may be found useful in certain
environments (for example, when compiling a single catalogue from a
variety of originally different sources), but which may safely be
ignored in others. --><!-- is this second sentence necessary? --></p>
<p>In very rare cases a repository may have only one manuscript (or
only one of any significance), which will have no shelfmark as such
but will be known by a particular name or names. In such
circumstances, the <gi>idno</gi> element may be omitted, and the
manuscript identified by  the name or names used for it, using
one or more <gi>msName</gi> elements, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<settlement>Rossano</settlement>
<repository xml:lang="it">Biblioteca arcivescovile</repository>
<msName xml:lang="la">Codex Rossanensis</msName>
<msName xml:lang="la">Codex purpureus</msName> 
<msName xml:lang="en">The Rossano Gospels</msName> 
</msIdentifier>
</egXML></p>
<p>Where manuscripts have moved from one institution to another, or
even within the same institution, they may have identifiers additional
to the ones currently used, such as former shelfmarks, which are
sometimes retained even after they have been officially superseded. In
such cases it may be useful to supply an alternative identifier using the
<gi>altIdentifier</gi> element, which has a detailed structure similar
to that of the <gi>msIdentifier</gi> element, and an additional
attribute <att>type</att> to indicate what kind of alternative
identifier this is. Only the following possibilities are envisaged:
<list type="gloss">
<label>former</label><item>former catalogue or shelf number</item>
<label>partial</label><item>identifier of a previously distinct
item</item>
<label>internal</label><item>internal project identifier</item>
<label>other</label><item>other unspecified identifier</item>
</list>

<specGrp xml:id="spec1">
<elementSpec ident="altIdentifier" module="msdescription" mode="change">

</valList>

  </attDef>
</attList>
</elementSpec>
</specGrp>
</p>

<p>The following example shows a manuscript which had shelfmark
<code>II-M-5</code> in the collection of the Duque de Osuna, but which
now has the shelfmark <code>MS 10237</code> in the National Library in
Madrid:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<settlement>Madrid</settlement>
<repository>Biblioteca Nacional</repository>
<idno>MS 10237</idno>
<altIdentifier type="former">
<region type="state">Andalucia</region>
<settlement>Osuna</settlement>
<repository>Duque de Osuna</repository>
<idno>II-M-5</idno>
</altIdentifier>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML>
Alternatively, such information may be dealt with under <gi>history</gi>
or <gi>adminInfo</gi>, except in
cases where a manuscript is likely still to be referred to or known by
its former identifier. 
<!-- For example, an institution may have changed
its call number system but still wish to retain a record of the earlier
number, perhaps because the manuscript concerned is frequently cited in print
under its previous number:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<settlement>Berkeley</settlement>
<institution>University of California</institution>
<repository>Bancroft Library</repository>
<idno>UCB 16</idno>
<altIdentifier type="former"><idno>2MS BS1145 I8</idno></altIdentifier>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML>
Where (as in this example) no repository is specified for the
<gi>altIdentifier</gi>, it is assumed to be the same as that of the
parent <gi>msIdentifier</gi>. Where the holding institution has only
one preferred form of citation but wishes to retain the other for
internal administrative purposes, the secondary could be given within
<gi>altIdentifier</gi> with an appropriate value on the
<att>type</att> attribute:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
<settlement>Oxford</settlement>
<repository>Bodleian Library</repository>
<idno>MS. Bodley 406</idno>
<altIdentifier type="former"><idno>2297</idno></altIdentifier>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML>
It might, however, be preferable to include such information within
the <gi>adminInfo</gi> element discussed in section <ptr
target="#msadad"/> below.-->
</p>

<p>Cases of such changed or alternative identifiers should be clearly
distinguished from cases of <soCalled>scattered</soCalled>
manuscripts, that is to say manuscripts which although physically
disjoint are nevertheless generally treated as single units. One
well-known example is the Old Church Slavonic manuscript known as
<title>Codex Suprasliensis</title>, substantial parts of which are to
be found in three separate repositories, in Ljubljana, Warsaw, and
St. Petersburg. This should be represented using three distinct
<gi>altIdentifier</gi> elements, using the value <val>partial</val> on the
type attribute to indicate that these three identifiers are not
alternate ways of referring to the same physical object, but three
parts of the same entity.

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msIdentifier>
  <msName xml:lang="la">Codex Suprasliensis</msName>

  </altIdentifier>
</msIdentifier>
</egXML></p>

<p>As mentioned above, the smallest possible description is one that
contains only the element <gi>msIdentifier</gi>; good practice in all
but exceptional circumstances requires the presence within it of the
three sub-elements <gi>settlement</gi>, <gi>repository</gi>, and
<gi>idno</gi>, since they provide what is, by common consent, the
minimum amount of information necessary to identify a manuscript.</p>
</div>
<!--
<div type="div2" xml:id="msdo">
<head>The Manuscript Heading</head>
<p>Historically, the briefest possible meaningful description of a
manuscript consists of no more than a title,
e.g. <mentioned>Polychronicon</mentioned>. This will often have been
enough to identify a manuscript in a small collection because the
identity of the author is implicit. Where a title does not imply the
author, and is thus insufficient to identify the main text of a
manuscript, the author should be stated explicitly
(e.g. <mentioned>Augustinus, Sermones</mentioned> or <mentioned>Cicero,
Letters</mentioned>). Many inventories of manuscripts consist of no
more than an author and title, with some form of copy-specific
identifier, such as a shelfmark or <soCalled>secundo folio</soCalled> reference
(e.g. <mentioned>Arch. B. 3. 2: Evangelium Matthei cum
glossa</mentioned>, <mentioned>126. Isidori Originum libri
octo</mentioned>, <mentioned>Biblia Hieronimi, 2o fo. opus
est</mentioned>); information on date and place of writing will
sometimes also be included. 
The standard TEI element <gi>head</gi>
element can be used to provide a brief description of this kind.
<specList>
<specDesc key="head"/>
</specList>
In this way the cataloguer or scholar can supply in one place a
minimum of essential information, such as might be displayed or
printed as the heading of a full description. </p>
<p>For ENRICH purposes, a <gi>head</gi> element is required, and must
contain the following summary elements:
<specList>
<specDesc key="author"/>
<specDesc key="title"/>
<specDesc key="origDate"/>
<specDesc key="origPlace"/>
</specList>

For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<head><author>Marsilius de Inghen</author>, <title>Abbreviata phisicorum Aristotelis</title>; <origPlace>Italy</origPlace>, <origDate>1463</origDate>.</head>
</egXML>

Any phrase-level elements, such as <gi>title</gi>, <gi>name</gi>,
<gi>date</gi>, or the specialized elements <gi>origPlace</gi> and
<gi>origDate</gi>, can also be used within a <gi>head</gi> element,
but it should be remembered that the <gi>head</gi> element is intended
principally to contain a heading. More
structured information concerning the contents, physical form, or
history of the manuscript should be given within the specialized
elements described below, <gi>msContents</gi>, <gi>physDesc</gi>,
<gi>history</gi>, etc. However, in simple cases, the <gi>p</gi>
element may also be used to supply an unstructured collection of
such information, as in the example given above (<ptr target="#msdesc"/>.
</p>
<p>A manuscript may often contain multiple works by multiple
authors. The <gi>head</gi> element should only be used to provide 
summary information:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<head><author>Hildegard of Bingen</author> et alii, <title>Opera varia</title>; <origPlace>Heidelberg</origPlace>, <origDate>1455</origDate>.</head>
</egXML>
which should be supported by a more detailed description using the
<gi>msContents</gi> element described in the next section.</p>

<!-- in Reykjavik, we removed head; I expect it will return though -->

<div type="div2" xml:id="msco">
<head>Intellectual Content</head>
<p>The <gi>msContents</gi> element is used to describe the
intellectual content of a manuscript or manuscript part. It comprises
<emph>either</emph> a series of informal prose paragraphs
<emph>or</emph> a series of <gi>msItem</gi> 
elements, each of which provides a more detailed description of a
single item contained within the manuscript. These may be prefaced, if
desired, by a <gi>summary</gi> element, which is especially useful
where one wishes to provide an overview of a manuscript's contents and
describe only some of the items in detail.
<specList>
<specDesc key="msContents"/>
<specDesc key="msItem"/>
</specList></p>
<p>In the simplest case, only a brief description may be provided, as
in the following examples:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msContents>
<p>A collection of Lollard sermons</p>
</msContents>
<msContents>
<p>Atlas of the world from Western Europe and Africa to Indochina, 
containing 27 maps and 26 tables</p>
</msContents>
<msContents>
<p>Biblia sacra: Antiguo y Nuevo Testamento, con prefacios, prólogos 
y argumentos de san Jerónimo y de otros. Interpretaciones de los 
nombres hebreos.</p>
</msContents>
</egXML></p>
<p>This description may of course be expanded to include any of the
TEI elements generally available within a <gi>p</gi> element, such as
<gi>title</gi>, <gi>bibl</gi>, or <gi>list</gi>. More usually,
however, each individual work within a manuscript will be given its
own description, using the <gi>msItem</gi>
element described in the next section, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<!-- I'm for killing off msItemStruct, personally -->
<p>Each discrete item in a manuscript or manuscript part can be described within a distinct <gi>msItem</gi> <!--or <gi>msItemStruct</gi>--> element, and may be classified using the <att>class</att> attribute.</p>
<p>These are the possible component elements of <gi>msItem</gi> <!--and <gi>msItemStruct</gi>-->.
<specList>
<specDesc key="author"/>
<specDesc key="respStmt"/>
<specDesc key="title" />
<specDesc key="rubric"/>

<specDesc key="bibl"/>
<specDesc key="filiation"/>
<specDesc key="note" />
<specDesc key="textLang"/>
</specList></p>
<p>If early printed material or incunables are described using this
schema, the <gi>msItem</gi> should be used to record details of each
distinct work contained by the incunable. In this situation, the
following extra elements may be found useful to transcribe relevant
details from the original titlepage:
<specList>
<specDesc key="docAuthor"/>
<specDesc key="docTitle"/>
<specDesc key="docImprint"/>
</specList>
These elements are also available within the <gi>msItem</gi> element.
</p>


<p>In addition,<!-- a <gi>msItemStruct</gi> may contain nested
<gi>msItemStruct</gi> elements, just as--> an <gi>msItem</gi> may contain
nested <gi>msItem</gi> elements.</p>
<!--<p>The main difference between <gi>msItem</gi> and <gi>msItemStruct</gi> is
that in the former, the order and number of child elements is not
constrained; any element, in other words, may be given in any order,
and repeated as often as is judged necessary. In the latter, however, the
sub-elements, if used, must be given in the order specified above and
only some of  them may be repeated; specifically,  <gi>rubric</gi>,
<gi>finalRubric</gi>.  <gi>incipit</gi>, <gi>textLang</gi> and
<gi>explicit</gi> can appear only once.</p>
<p>While  neither
<gi>msItem</gi> nor <gi>msItemStruct</gi> -->
<p>Untagged running
text is not permitted directly within an <gi>msItem</gi>, unless it is
given within a <gi>p</gi> element, in which case 
none of the other component elements listed above is permitted.
</p>
<p>The elements <gi>msContents</gi>, <gi>msItem</gi>,
<!--<gi>msItemStruct</gi>, --><gi>incipit</gi>, and <gi>explicit</gi> are all
members of the class <ident type="class">att.msExcerpt</ident> from
which they inherit the <att>defective</att> attribute.
<specList>
<specDesc key="att.msExcerpt" atts="defective"/>
</specList>
This attribute can be used for example with collections
of fragments, where each fragment is given as a separate
<gi>msItem</gi> and the first and last words of each fragment are transcribed as
defective incipits and explicits <!--, as in the following example, a
manuscript containing four fragments of a single work:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msContents>
<msItem defective="true"><locus from="1r" to="9v">1r-9v</locus>
<title>Knýtlinga saga</title>
<msItem n="1.1"><locus from="1r:1" to="2v:30">1r:1-2v:30</locus>
<incipit defective="true">dan<ex>n</ex>a a

<explicit defective="true">en meðan <expan>haraldr</expan>

yf<ex>ir</ex> danmork</explicit>
</msItem>
</msItem>
</msContents>
</egXML></p>
<p>The elements <gi>ex</gi>, <gi>am</gi>, and
<gi>expan</gi> used in the above example are further discussed in
section <ptr target="#PHAB"/>; they are available  only when the <ident type="module">transcr</ident> module defined by that chapter is
selected. Similarly, the <gi>g</gi> element used in this example to
represent the abbreviation mark is defined by the <ident type="module">gaiji</ident> module documented in chapter <ptr target="#WD"/>-->. </p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msat"><head>Authors and Titles</head>
<p>When used within a manuscript description, the <gi>title</gi> element should be used to supply a regularized
form of the item's title, as distinct from any rubric quoted from the
manuscript. If the item concerned has a standardized distinctive
title, e.g. <mentioned>Roman de la Rose</mentioned>, then this should
be the form given as content of the <gi>title</gi> element, with the
value of the <att>type</att> attribute given as
<code>uniform</code>. If no uniform title exists for an item, or none
has been yet identified, or if one wishes to provide a general
designation of the contents, then a <soCalled>supplied</soCalled>
title can be given, e.g. <mentioned>missal</mentioned>, in which case
the <att>type</att> attribute on the <gi>title</gi> should be given
the value <code>supplied</code>.</p>

<p>Similarly, if used within a manuscript description, the
<gi>author</gi> element should always contain the normalized form of
an author's name, irrespective of how (or whether) this form of the
name is cited in the manuscript. If it is desired to retain the form
of the author's name as given in the manuscript, this should be given
in the <gi>docAuthor</gi> element, or  as
a distinct <gi>name</gi> element, within the text at the point where
it occurs. </p>
<!-- an example would be nice here -->
<p>Note that the <att>key</att> or <att>ref</att> attributes can be
used, on titles and on author names as on names in general, to link
the name to a more detailed description of the person or work
concerned (see further <ptr target="#msnames"/>).</p>
<p>The <gi>respStmt</gi> element can be used to supply the name and role of a person other than the author who is responsible for some aspect of the intellectual content of the manuscript:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<author>Diogenes Laertius</author>
<respStmt>
<resp>in the translation of</resp>
<name type="person">Ambrogio Traversari</name>
</respStmt>
</egXML></p>
<p>The <gi>resp</gi> element is also a member of the
<ident>att.canonical</ident> class, from which it inherits the
<att>key</att> attribute. For ENRICH purposes, this may be used to
supply a standard relationship code for the kind of
responsibility concerned, as defined in the
list maintained at <ptr
target="http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/relacode.html"/>:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<respStmt>
 <resp key="trl">přeložil</resp>
 <name type="person">John Enrich</name>
</respStmt>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>The <gi>respStmt</gi> element can also be used where there is a discrepancy between the author of an item as given in the manuscript and the accepted scholarly view, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<title type="supplied">Sermons on the Epistles and the Gospels</title>
<respStmt>
<resp>here erroneously attributed to</resp>
<name type="person">St. Bonaventura</name>
</respStmt>
</egXML>
Note that such attributions of authorship, both correct and incorrect, are frequently found in the rubric or final rubric (and occasionally also elsewhere in the text), and can therefore be transcribed and included in the description, if desired, using the <gi>rubric</gi>, <gi>finalRubric</gi>, or <gi>quote</gi> elements, as appropriate.
</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="mscorie"><head>Rubrics, Incipits, Explicits, and Other Quotations from the Text</head>
<p>It is customary in a manuscript description to record the opening
and closing words of a text as well as any headings or colophons it
might have, and the specialised elements <gi>rubric</gi>,
<gi>incipit</gi>, <gi>explicit</gi>, <gi>finalRubric</gi>, and
<gi>colophon</gi> are available within <gi>msItem</gi> for doing so,
along with the more general <gi>quote</gi>, for recording other bits of
the text not covered by these elements. Each of these elements has the
same substructure, containing a mixture of phrase-level elements and
plain text. A <gi>locus</gi> element can be included within each, in
order to specify the location of the component, as in the following
example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msContents>
<msItem><locus>f. 1-223</locus>
<author>Radulphus Flaviacensis</author>
<title>Expositio super Leviticum </title>
<incipit><locus>f. 1r</locus>
Forte Hervei monachi</incipit>
<explicit><locus>f. 223v</locus>
Benedictio salis et aquae</explicit>
</msItem>
</msContents>
</egXML></p>
<p>In the following example, standard TEI elements for the transcription of primary
sources have been used to mark
the expansion of abbreviations and other features present in the original:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msItem defective="true">
<locus>ff. 1r-24v</locus>
<title type="uniform">Ágrip af Noregs konunga sǫgum</title>
<incipit defective="true">regi oc h<ex>ann</ex> seti

<explicit defective="true">h<ex>on</ex> hev<ex>er</ex>

h<ex>on</ex>o<ex>m</ex> annan til reiþ<ex>ar</ex></explicit>
</msItem>
</egXML>
Note here also the use of the <att>defective</att> attribute on <gi>incipit</gi> and <gi>explicit</gi> to indicate that the text begins and ends defectively.
</p>
<p>The <att>xml:lang</att> attribute for <gi>colophon</gi>, <gi>explicit</gi>, <gi>incipit</gi>, <gi>quote</gi>, and <gi>rubric</gi> may always be used to identify the language of the text quoted, if this is different from the default language specified by the <att>mainLang</att> attribute on <gi>textLang</gi>.</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msfil">
<head>Filiation</head>
<p>The <gi>filiation</gi> element can be used to provide information on the relationship between the manuscript and other surviving manuscripts of the same text, either specifically or in a general way, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msItem>
  <locus>118rb</locus>
  <incipit>Ecce morior cum nichil horum ... <ref>[Dn 13, 43]</ref>. Verba ista dixit Susanna de illis</incipit>

  <bibl>Schneyer 3, 436 (Johannes Contractus OFM)</bibl>
  <filiation>weitere Überl. Uppsala C 181, 35r.</filiation>
</msItem>
</egXML>
</p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msclass"><head>Text Classification</head>
<p>One or more text classification or text-type codes may be
specified, either for the whole of the <gi>msContents</gi> element, or
for one or more of its constituent <gi>msItem</gi> elements, using the
<att>class</att> attribute as specified above:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msContents>
<msItem n="1" defective="false" class="#law">
<locus from="1v" to="71v">1v-71v</locus>

<explicit>en<ex>n</ex> u<ex>ir</ex>da 
þo t<ex>il</ex> fullra aura</explicit>
</msItem>
</msContents></egXML>
The value of the <att>class</att> attribute
should specify the identifier used for the appropriate classification
within a <gi>taxonomy</gi> element, defined in the <gi>classDecl</gi>
element of the TEI Header (<ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD55"/>), as
shown here:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

</egXML></p>
<p><note rend="query">Should  ENRICH
 define its own taxonomy for this purpose, or re-use an
existing one?</note></p>
</div>
<div type="div3" xml:id="mslangs">
<head>Languages and Writing Systems</head>
<p>The <gi>textLang</gi> element should be used to provide
information about the languages used within a manuscript item. It may take
the form of a simple note, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<textLang mainLang="chu">Old Church Slavonic, written in Cyrillic script.</textLang>
</egXML></p>

<specGrp xml:id="spec2">
<elementSpec ident="textLang" mode="change" module="msdescription">
<attList>
  <attDef ident="mainLang" mode="change" usage="req"/>
</attList>
</elementSpec>
</specGrp>

<p>For validation and indexing purposes, the <att>mainLang</att>
attribute muse be supplied:  it takes
the same range of values as the global <att>xml:lang</att> attribute,
on which see further <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CH.html#CHSH"/>. 
When a manuscript item  contains material in more than one language, the
<att>mainLang</att> attribute should be used only for the chief language. 
Other languages used may be specified using the <att>otherLangs</att>
attribute as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<textLang mainLang="chu" otherLangs="RUS HEL">Mostly Old Church 
Slavonic, with some Russian and Greek material</textLang>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>Since Old Church Slavonic may be written in either
Cyrillic or Glagolitic scripts, and even occasionally in both within the
same manuscript, it might be preferable to use a more explicit
identifier:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<textLang mainLang="chu-Cyrs">Old Church Slavonic in Cyrillic script</textLang>
</egXML></p>
<p>The form and scope of language identifiers recommended by these
Guidelines is based on the IANA standard described at <ptr
target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/html/CH.html#CHSH"/> and
should be followed throughout. Where additional detail is needed
correctly to describe a language, or to discuss its deployment in a
given text, this should be done using the <gi>langUsage</gi> element
in the TEI Header, within which individual <gi>language</gi> elements
document the languages used: see <ptr target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/HD.html#HD41"/>.  </p>
<p>Note that the <gi>language</gi> element defines a particular
combination of human language and writing system. Only one
<gi>language</gi> element may be supplied for each such
combination. Standard TEI practice also allows this element to be
referenced by any element using the global <att>xml:lang</att>
attribute in order to specify the language applicable to the content
of that element. For example, assuming that <gi>language</gi>
elements have been defined with the identifiers <ident>fr</ident> (for
French), <ident>la</ident> (for Latin), and <ident>de</ident> (for
German), a manuscript description written in French which specifies
that a particular manuscript contains predominantly German but also
some Latin material, might
have a <gi>textLang</gi> element like the following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<textLang xml:lang="fr" mainLang="de" otherLangs="la">allemand et latin</textLang>
</egXML></p>
</div></div>
<div type="div2" xml:id="msph">
<head>Physical Description</head>
<p>Under the general heading <soCalled>physical description</soCalled>
we subsume a large number of different aspects generally regarded as
useful in the description of a given manuscript. These include:
<list>
<item>aspects
of the form, support, extent, and quire structure of the manuscript
object and of the way in which the text is laid out on the page (<ptr target="#msph1"/>);</item>
<item>the styles of writing, such as the way it is laid out on the
page, the styles of writing, decorative features, any musical notation
employed and any annotations or marginalia (<ptr
target="#msph2"/>);</item>
<item> and discussion of its binding, seals, and any
accompanying material (<ptr target="#msph3"/>).</item>
</list></p>
<p>Most manuscript descriptions touch on several of these categories
of information though few include them all, and not all distinguish
them as clearly as we propose here. In particular, it is often the
case that an existing description will include within a single
paragraph, or even
sentence, information for which
we propose distinct elements. In this case, if rewriting is not an option, the
existing prose must be marked up simply as a series of <gi>p</gi> elements,
directly within the <gi>physDesc</gi> element.</p>
<p>The <gi>physDesc</gi> element may thus be used in either of two
distinct ways. It may contain a series of paragraphs addressing topics
listed above and similar ones. Alternatively, it may act as a container for any
choice of the more specialized elements described in the remainder of
this section, each of which itself contains a series of paragraphs,
and may also have more specific attributes. If the two ways
are  combined in a single description, care should be taken to avoid
duplication and all paragraphs of generic description must precede the first
of the more specialised elements.</p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msph1"><head>Object Description</head>
<p>The <gi>objectDesc</gi> element is used to group together those
parts of the physical description which relate specifically to the
text-bearing object, its format, constitution, layout, etc. The
<att>form</att> attribute is used to indicate the specific type of
writing vehicle being described: it must be supplied, and its
value must be one of <val>codex</val>, <val>scroll</val>,
<val>leaf</val>, or <val>other</val>. If no value is
supplied, the value <val>codex</val> will be assumed.

<specGrp xml:id="spec3">

</valList>

</attDef></attList>
</elementSpec>
</specGrp>

The <gi>objectDesc</gi> element has two parts: a description of the
<term>support</term>, i.e. the physical carrier on which the text is
inscribed; and a description of the <term>layout</term>, i.e. the way
text is organized on the carrier.</p>
<p>Taking these in turn, the description of the support is tagged
using the following elements, each of which is discussed in more
detail below:
<specList>
<specDesc key="supportDesc" atts="material"/>
<specDesc key="support"/>
<specDesc key="extent"/>
<specDesc key="collation"/>
<specDesc key="foliation"/>
<specDesc key="condition"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Each of these elements contains paragraphs relating to the topic
concerned. Within these paragraphs, phrase-level elements (in
particular those discussed above at <ptr target="#msphrase"/>),
may be used to tag specific terms of interest if so
desired.</p>
<p>The <att>form</att> attribute on <gi>supportDesc</gi> is used to
summarize briefly the materials used for the support. For ENRICH
purposes, it must have one of the following values:
<val>perg</val> (parchment), 
<val>chart</val> (paper), 
<val>mixed</val>, <val>unknown</val>.

<specGrp xml:id="spec4">
<elementSpec ident="supportDesc" mode="change" module="msdescription">

<p>Here is a simple example:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<p>This example combines information which might alternatively be more
precisely tagged using the more specific elements described in the
following subsections.</p>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msph1sup">
<head>Support</head>
<p>The <gi>support</gi> element groups together information about the
physical carrier. Typically, for western manuscripts, this will entail
discussion of the material (parchment, paper, or a combination of the
two) written on. For paper, a discussion of any watermarks present may
also be useful.  If this discussion makes reference to standard
catalogues of such items, these may be tagged using the standard
<gi>ref</gi> element as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<support><p>
<material>Paper</material> with watermark: <watermark>anchor in a circle 
with star on top</watermark>, <watermark>countermark B-B with 
trefoil</watermark> similar to <ref>Moschin, Anchor N 1680</ref>
<date>1570-1585</date>.</p></support>
</egXML></p>
</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msph1ext">
<head>Extent</head>
<p>The <gi>extent</gi> element, defined in the TEI header, may also be
used in a manuscript description to specify the number of
leaves a manuscript contains, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<extent>ii + 97 + ii</extent>
</egXML>
Information regarding the size of the leaves may be
specifically marked using the phrase level <gi>dimensions</gi>
element, as in the following example, or left as plain prose.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<extent>ii + 321 leaves 
<dimensions type="leaf" unit="cm">
<height>35</height>
<width>27</width>
</dimensions>
</extent>
</egXML></p>
<!--
<p>Alternatively, the generic <gi>measure</gi> element might be used within <gi>extent</gi>, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<extent>
  <measure type="composition" unit="leaf" quantity="10">10 Bl.</measure>
  <measure type="height" quantity="37" unit="cm">37</measure> x

<div type="div4" xml:id="msph1col">
<head>Collation</head>
<p>The <gi>collation</gi> element should be used to provide a
description of a book's current and original structure, that is, the
arrangement of its leaves and quires. This information may be conveyed
using informal prose, or any appropriate notational
convention. Although no specific notation is defined here, an
appropriate element to enclose such an expression would be the <gi>formula</gi>
element, which is provided when the <ident type="module">figures</ident> module is included in a schema. Here are some examples of different ways of treating collation:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<div type="div4" xml:id="msphfo">
<head>Foliation</head>
<p>The <gi>foliation</gi> element may be used to indicate the scheme,
medium or location of folio, page, column, or line numbers written in
the manuscript, frequently including a statement about when and, if
known, by whom, the numbering was done.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

</p>
<p>Where a manuscript contains traces of more than
one foliation, each should be recorded as a distinct
<gi>foliation</gi> element and optionally given a distinct value for
its <att>xml:id</att> attribute. The <gi>locus</gi> element discussed in
<ptr target="#msloc"/> can then indicate which foliation scheme is being cited
by means of its <att>scheme</att> attribute, which points to this
identifier:

<div type="div4" xml:id="msphco">
<head>Condition</head>
<p>The <gi>condition</gi> element is used to summarize the overall
physical state of a manuscript, in particular where such information
is not recorded elsewhere in the description. It should not, however, be
used to describe changes or repairs to a manuscript, as these are more
appropriately described as a part of its custodial history (see <ptr
target="#msadch"/>). When used solely to describe the condition of
the binding, it should appear within the <gi>bindingDesc</gi> element
(<ptr target="#msphbi"/>).
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<condition><p>The manuscript shows signs of damage from water and mould on its outermost leaves.</p></condition>
<condition><p>Despite tears on many of the leaves the codex is reasonably well preserved. 
The top and the bottom of f. 1 is damaged, and only a thin slip is left of the original second

one leaf between ff. 193 and 194. The manuscript ends defectively (there are approximately six 
leaves missing).</p></condition>
</egXML></p>
</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msphla"><head>Layout Description</head>

<p>The second part of the <gi>objectDesc</gi> element is the
<gi>layoutDesc</gi> element, which is used to describe and document
the <foreign>mise-en-page</foreign> of the manuscript, that is the way
in which text and illumination are arranged on the page, specifying
for example the number of written, ruled, or pricked lines and columns
per page, size of margins, distinct blocks such as glosses,
commentaries, etc. This may be given as a simple series of
paragraphs. Alternatively, one or more different layouts may be
identified within a single manuscript, each described by its own
<gi>layout</gi> element.
<specList>
<specDesc key="layoutDesc"/>
<specDesc key="layout"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Where the <gi>layout</gi> element is used, the layout will often be
sufficiently regular for the attributes on this element to convey all
that is necessary; more usually however a more detailed treatment will
be required. The attributes are provided as a convenient shorthand for
commonly occurring cases, and should not be used except where the
layout is regular. The value <code>NA</code> (not-applicable) should
be used for cases where the layout is either very irregular, or where
it cannot be characterized simply in terms of lines and columns, for
example, where blocks of commentary and text are arranged in a regular
but complex pattern on each page</p>
<p>The following examples indicate the range of possibilities:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<layout ruledLines="25 32" columns="1">
<p>Most pages have between 25 and 32 long lines ruled in lead.</p>
</layout>
<layout columns="1" writtenLines="24">
<p>Written in one column throughout; 24 lines per page.</p>
</layout>
<layout columns="1"><p>Written in a single column, with 8 lines of text and interlinear glosses in 
the centre, and up to 26 lines of gloss in the outer two columns. Double 
vertical bounding lines ruled in hard point on hair side. Text lines ruled 
faintly in lead. Remains of prickings in upper, lower, and outer (for 8 lines 
of text only) margins.</p></layout>
</egXML></p>
<p>Note that if (as in the last example above) no value is given for
the <att>columns</att> attribute, the assumption is that there is a
single column of writing on each page.

<p>Where multiple <gi>layout</gi> elements are supplied, the scope for

<layout ruledLines="25 32" columns="1">

<div type="div4" xml:id="msphwr">
<head>Writing</head>

<p>The <gi>handDesc</gi> element can contain a short description of
the general characteristics of the writing observed in a manuscript,
as in the following example:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<handDesc>
<p>Written in a <term>late Caroline minuscule</term>; versals in a 
form of <term>rustic capitals</term>; although the marginal and 
interlinear gloss is written in varying shades of ink that are 
not those of the main text, text and gloss appear to have been 
copied during approximately the same time span.</p>
</handDesc>
</egXML></p>
<p>Note the use of the <gi>term</gi> element to mark specific technical
terms within the context of the <gi>handDesc</gi> element.</p>
<p>Where several distinct hands have been identified, this fact can be registered by using the <att>hands</att> attribute, as in
the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<handDesc hands="2">
<p>The manuscript is written in two contemporary hands, otherwise
unknown, but clearly those of practised scribes. Hand I writes
ff. 1r-22v and hand II ff. 23 and 24. Some scholars, notably
Verner Dahlerup and Hreinn Benediktsson, have argued for a third hand
on f. 24, but the evidence for this is insubstantial.</p>
</handDesc>
</egXML></p>
<p>Where more specific
information about one or more of the hands identified is to be recorded,
the <gi>handNote</gi> element should
be used, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<handDesc hands="3">
<handNote xml:id="Eirsp-1" scope="minor" script="textualis">
<p>The first part of the manuscript, 
<locus from="1v" to="72v:4">fols 1v-72v:4</locus>, is written in a practised 
Icelandic Gothic bookhand. This hand is not found elsewhere.</p></handNote>
<handNote xml:id="Eirsp-2" scope="major" script="textualis">
<p>The second part of the manuscript, <locus from="72v:4" to="194v">fols 
72v:4-194</locus>, is written in a hand contemporary with the first; it can 
also be found in a fragment of <title>Knýtlinga saga</title>, 
<ref>AM 20b II fol.</ref>.</p></handNote>
<handNote xml:id="Eirsp-3" scope="minor" script="cursiva">
<p>The third hand has written the majority of the chapter headings. 
This hand has been identified as the one also found in <ref>AM 
221 fol.</ref>.</p></handNote>
</handDesc>
</egXML>
</p>
<p>As the above example shows, the attributes <att>script</att> and
<att>scope</att> are both required on <gi>handNote</gi>. For ENRICH
purposes, the <att>script</att> attribute must take one of the following values:
<val>carolmin</val>, 
<val>textualis</val>, 
<val>cursiva</val>, 
<val>hybrida</val>, 
<val>humbook</val>, 
<val>humcursiva</val>, or <val>other</val>, and the <att>scope</att>
attribute must take one of the following values:
<val>sole</val>, 
<val>major</val>, 
<val>minor</val>.</p>

<p>If early printed material or incunables are described using this
schema, the <gi>typeDesc</gi> and <gi>typeNote</gi> elements may be
used (in the same way as <gi>handDesc</gi> and <gi>handNote</gi>) to
record information about the typefaces etc. of interest in the source.
<!-- example needed --> 
Both <gi>typeDesc</gi> and <gi>handDesc</gi> may be supplied, for
example in the case where a printed work has been annotated by a
number of hands. </p>

<p>The <gi>locus</gi> element, discussed in
section <ptr target="#msloc"/>, may be used to specify which parts of a
manuscript are written by a given hand.</p>

<p>In addition, when a full or partial transcription of a manuscript
is available in addition to the manuscript description, the
<gi>handShift</gi> element described in <ptr
target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PHDH"/>
can be used to link the relevant parts of the transcription to the
appropriate <gi>handNote</gi> or <gi>typeNote</gi> element in the
description: for example, at the point in the transcript where the
second hand listed above starts (i.e. at folio 72v:4), we might insert
<code>&lt;handShift new="#Eirsp-2"/></code>.</p>
<p>No <gi>typeShift</gi> element is proposed; if it is felt
inappropriate to use <gi>handShift</gi> for this purpose, the generic
<gi>mileStone</gi> may be used.
<!-- example needed --></p>
</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msphdec">
<head>Decoration</head>
<p>It can be difficult to draw a clear distinction between aspects of
a manuscript which are purely physical and those which form part of
its intellectual content. This is particularly true of illuminations
and other forms of decoration in a manuscript. We propose the
following elements for the purpose of delimiting discussion of these
aspects within a manuscript description, and for convenience locate
them all within the physical description, despite the fact that the
illustrative features of a manuscript will in many cases also be seen
as constitutiing part of its intellectual content.</p>
<p>The <gi>decoDesc</gi> element may contain simply one or more
paragraphs summarizing the overall nature of the decorative features
of the manuscript, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<decoDesc>
<p>The decoration comprises two full page miniatures, perhaps added 
by the original owner, or slightly later; the original major decoration
consists of twenty-three large miniatures, illustrating the divisions of 
the Passion narrative and the start of the major texts, and the major 
divisions of the Hours; seventeen smaller miniatures, illustrating the 
suffrages to saints; and seven historiated initials, illustrating
the pericopes and major prayers.</p>
</decoDesc>
</egXML>
Alternatively, it may contain a series of more specific typed
<gi>decoNote</gi> elements, each summarizing a particular aspect or
individual instance of the decoration present, for example the use of
miniatures, initials (historiated or otherwise), borders, diagrams,
etc. The scope of the description is indicated by the <att>type</att>
attribute which, for ENRICH purposes, must take one of the following
values:
<val>border</val>, 
<val>diagram</val>, 
<val>initial</val>, 
<val>marginal</val>, 
<val>miniature</val>, 
<val>mixed</val>, 
<val>paratext</val>, 
<val>secondary</val>, 
<val>other</val>.

border decoration accompanying the historiated and decorated initials.</p>
</decoNote>
</decoDesc>
</egXML></p>
<p>Where more exact indexing of the decorative content of a manuscript
is required, the standard TEI elements <gi>term</gi> or <gi>index</gi>
may be used within the prose description to supply or delimit
appropriate iconographic terms, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msphmu"><head>Musical Notation</head>
<p>Where a manuscript contains music, the <gi>musicNotation</gi>
element may be used to describe the form of notation employed, as in
the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<musicNotation>
<p>Square notation on 4-line red staves.</p>
</musicNotation>

</div>
<div type="div4" xml:id="mspham"><head>Additions and Marginalia</head>
<p>The <gi>additions</gi> element can be used to list or describe any
additions to the manuscript, such as marginalia, scribblings, doodles,
etc., which are considered to be of interest or importance. Such
topics may also be discussed or referenced elsewhere in a description,
for example in the <gi>history</gi> element, in cases where the
marginalia provide evidence of ownership. Some examples follow:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<additions><p>Doodles on most leaves, possibly by children, and often quite amusing.</p></additions>
<additions><p xml:lang="fr">Quelques annotations marginales des XVIe et XVIIe s.</p></additions>
<additions>
<p>The text of this manuscript is not interpolated with sentences from 
Royal decrees promulgated in 1294, 1305 and 1314. In the margins, however, 
another somewhat later scribe has added the relevant paragraphs of these 
decrees, see pp. 8, 24, 44, 47 etc.</p>
<p>As a humorous gesture the scribe in one opening of the manuscript, pp. 36 
and 37, has prolonged the lower stems of one letter f and five letters þ 
and has them drizzle down the margin.</p>
</additions>
<additions>
<p>Spaces for initials and chapter headings were left by the scribe but not filled in. 
A later, probably fifteenth-century, hand has added initials and chapter headings in 
greenish-coloured ink on fols <locus>8r</locus>, <locus>8v</locus>, <locus>9r</locus>, 
<locus>10r</locus> and <locus>11r</locus>. Although a few of these chapter headings are 
now rather difficult to read, most can be made out, e.g. fol. <locus>8rb</locus> 
<quote xml:lang="is">floti ast<ex>ri</ex>d<ex>ar</ex></quote>; fol. <locus>9rb</locus> 
<quote xml:lang="is">v<ex>m</ex> olaf conung</quote>, and fol. <locus>10ra</locus> 
<quote xml:lang="is">Gipti<ex>n</ex>g ol<ex>a</ex>fs k<ex>onun</ex>gs</quote>.</p>
<p>The manuscript contains the following marginalia:
<list>
<item>Fol. <locus>4v</locus>, left margin: <quote xml:lang="is">hialmadr <ex>ok</ex> <lb/>brynjadr</quote>, 
in a fifteenth-cenury hand, imitating an addition made to the text by the scribe at this point.</item>

<div type="div3" xml:id="msph3"><head>Bindings, Seals, and Additional Material</head>
<p>The third major component of the physical description relates to
supporting but distinct physical components, such as bindings, 
seals and accompanying material. These may be described using the following specialist elements:

<div type="div4" xml:id="msphbi"><head>Binding Descriptions</head>
<p>The <gi>bindingDesc</gi> element contains a description of the state of
the present and former bindings of a manuscript, including information
about its material, any distinctive marks, and provenance information. This may
be given as a series of paragraphs, if only one binding is being described, or
as a series of distinct <gi>binding</gi> elements, each describing a distinct
binding, where these are separately described. For example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<bindingDesc>
<p>Sewing not visible; tightly rebound over 19th-century pasteboards, reusing 
panels of 16th-century brown leather with gilt tooling à la fanfare, Paris

of red morocco tooled in gilt (perhaps replacing the identifying mark of a 
previous owner); the spine similarly tooled, without raised bands or title-piece; 
coloured endbands; the edges of the leaves and boards gilt. Boxed.</p>

</egXML>
</p>
<p>Within a binding description, the element <gi>decoNote</gi> is

<div type="div4" xml:id="msadac"><head>Accompanying Material</head>
<p>The circumstance may arise where material not originally part of a
manuscript is bound into or otherwise kept with a manuscript. In some
cases this material would best be treated in a separate
<gi>msPart</gi> element (see <ptr target="#mspt"/> below).  There are,
however, cases where the additional matter is not self-evidently a
distinct manuscript: it might, for example, be a set of notes by a
later scholar, or a file of correspondence relating to the
manuscript. The <gi>accMat</gi> element is provided as a holder for
this kind of information.
<specList>
<specDesc key="accMat"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Here is an example of the use of this element, describing a note by
the Icelandic manuscript collector Árni Magnússon which
has been bound with the manuscript:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<accMat>
<p>A slip in Árni Magnússon's hand has been stuck to the
pastedown on the inside front cover; the text reads:

<head>History</head>
<p>The following elements are used to record information about the history of a manuscript:
<specList>
<specDesc key="history"/>
<specDesc key="origin"/>
<specDesc key="provenance"/>
<specDesc key="acquisition"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The three components of the <gi>history</gi> element all have the
same substructure, consisting of one or more paragraphs marked as
<gi>p</gi> elements. Each of these three elements is also a member of
the <ident type="class">att.datable</ident> attribute class, itself a
member of the <ident type="class">att.datable.w3c</ident> class, and
thus also carries the following optional attributes:
<specList><specDesc key="att.datable.w3c" atts="notBefore notAfter
						from to when">
</specDesc></specList></p>
<p>Information about the origins of the manuscript, its place and date
of writing, should be given as one or more paragraphs contained by a
single <gi>origin</gi> element; following this, any available
information on distinct stages in the history of the manuscript before
its acquisition by its current holding institution should be included
as paragraphs within one or more <gi>provenance</gi>
elements. Finally, any information specific to the means by which the
manuscript was acquired by its present owners should be given as
paragraphs within the <gi>acquisition</gi> element.</p>
<p>Here is a fairly simple example of the use of this element:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<history>
<origin><p>Written in <origPlace>Durham</origPlace> during <origDate notBefore="1125" notAfter="1175">the

<head>Additional information</head>
<p>Three categories of additional information are provided for by the
scheme described here, grouped together within the <gi>additional</gi>
element described in this section.
<specList>
<specDesc key="additional"/>
<specDesc key="adminInfo"/>
<specDesc key="surrogates"/>
<specDesc key="listBibl"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>surrogates</gi> element should not be used to describe
digital images of the manuscript  since the
<gi>facsimile</gi> element described in <ptr target="#facs"/> is
provided for this purpose.</p>
<p>None of the constituent elements of <gi>additional</gi> is
required. If any is supplied, it may appear once only; furthermore,
the order in which elements are supplied should be as specified above.</p>
<div type="div3" xml:id="msadad">
<head>Administrative information</head>
<p>The <gi>adminInfo</gi> element is used to hold information relating to the curation and management of
a manuscript.  This may be supplied  using
<gi>note</gi> element. Alternatively, different aspects of this
information may be presented grouped within one<!-- or more-->
of the following specialized elements:
<specList>
<specDesc key="recordHist"/>
<specDesc key="availability" atts="status"/>
<specDesc key="custodialHist"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <att>status</att> attribute of <gi>availability</gi> must take
one of the following values: <val>free</val>, <val>restricted</val>,  <val>unknown</val>.
</p>
<div type="div4" xml:id="msrh"><head>Record History</head>
<p>The <gi>recordHist</gi> element may contain either a series of
paragraphs or a single <gi>source</gi> element. It is used to document
the primary source of information for the record containing it, in a
similar way to the standard TEI <gi>sourceDesc</gi> element within a
TEI Header. If the record is a new one, made without reference to
anything other than the manuscript itself, then it may be omitted, or
simply contain a <gi>p</gi> element, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<source><p>Directly catalogued from the original manuscript.</p></source>
</egXML></p>
<p>Frequently, however, the record will be derived from some
previously existing description, which may be specified using the
 <gi>bibl</gi> element, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<recordHist>
<source><p>Information transcribed from <bibl><title>The index of
Middle English verse</title><biblScope unit="pages">123</biblScope></bibl>.</p></source>
</recordHist>
</egXML></p>
<p>If, as is likely, a full bibliographic description of the source
from which cataloguing information was taken is included within the
<gi>listBibl</gi> element contained by the current <gi>additional</gi>
element, or elsewhere in the current document, then it need not be
repeated here. Instead, it should be referenced using the standard TEI
<gi>ref</gi> element, as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><additional>
  <adminInfo>
    <recordHist>
    <source>
      <p>Information transcribed from

<p>The <gi>change</gi> element 
within the <gi>revisionDesc</gi> element of the

<gi>recordHist</gi> element. </p>

</div><div type="div4" xml:id="msadch"><head>Availability and Custodial History</head>
<p>The <gi>availability</gi> element is another element also available
in  the TEI Header,
which should be used here to supply any information concerning
access to the current manuscript, such as its physical location (where this
is not implicit in its identifier), any restrictions on access, information
about copyright, etc.
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

<p>The <gi>custodialHist</gi> record is used to describe the custodial
history of a manuscript, recording any significant events noted during
the period that it has been located within its holding institution. It
may contain either a series of 
<gi>p</gi> elements, or a series of <gi>custEvent</gi> elements, each
describing a distinct incident or event, further specified by a
<att>type</att> attribute, and carrying dating information by virtue
of its membership in the <ident type="class">att.datable</ident> class, as noted above.
<specList>
<specDesc key="custEvent"/>
</specList></p>
<p>For ENRICH purposes, the values of this attribute must be one of
the following: <val>check</val>, <val>conservation</val>,

<div type="div3" xml:id="msadsu">
<head>Surrogates</head>
<p>The <gi>surrogates</gi> element is used
to provide information about any digital or photographic
representations of the manuscript which may exist within the holding
institution or elsewhere. 
<specList>
<specDesc key="surrogates"/>
</specList></p>
<p>The <gi>surrogates</gi> element should not be used to repeat
information about representations of the manuscript available within
published works; this should normally be documented within the
<gi>listBibl</gi> element within the <gi>additional</gi>
element. However, it is often also convenient to record information
such as negative numbers or digital identifiers for unpublished
collections of manuscript images maintained within the holding
institution, as well as to provide more detailed descriptive
information about the surrogate itself. Such information may be provided
as prose paragraphs, within which identifying information about particular
surrogates may be presented using the standard TEI <gi>bibl</gi> element,
as in the following example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

</bibl>
</p>
</surrogates>
</egXML>
Note the use of the specialized form of title (<term>general material designation</term>) to specify the kind of surrogate being documented.</p>
<p>For ENRICH purposes, information about digital
images of the manuscript being described should be provided within the

below rather than within the  <gi>surrogates</gi> element.</p>
</div>

<div type="div2" xml:id="mspt">
<head>Manuscript Parts</head>
<p>The <gi>msPart</gi> element may be used in cases where what were
originally physically separate manuscripts or parts of manuscripts
have been bound together and/or share the same call number.
<specList>
<specDesc key="msPart"/>
</specList></p>
<p>Since each component of such a composite manuscript will in all
likelihood have its own content, physical description, history, and so
on, the structure of <gi>msPart</gi> is in the main identical to that
of <gi>msDesc</gi>, allowing one to retain the top level of
identity (<gi>msIdentifier</gi>), but to branch out thereafter into as
many parts, or even subparts, as necessary. If the parts of a
composite manuscript have their own identifiers, they should be tagged
using the <gi>idno</gi> element, rather than the <gi>msIdentifier</gi>
element, as in the following example:
<!-- don't understand why these need to to wrapped in <altIdentifier> -->
<!-- I don't either, but now it has to be wrapped in an

<div xml:id="facs"><head>Metadata about digital facsimiles</head>
<p>The <gi>facsimile</gi> element is used to describe the digital
images of the manuscript being made available to the ENRICH
project. It contains, as a minimum, one <gi>surface</gi> element for
each distinct page image, which in turn specifies one or more
<gi>graphic</gi> element. These elements are used as described in the
<ref
    target="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/PH.html#PHFACS">TEI Guidelines, section11.1</ref>. </p>
<p>Here is a simple example:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<facsimile xml:base="http://www.handrit.org/AM/fol/">
        <surface xml:id="LSB-1r" ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="200" lry="300">
            <graphic mimeType="jpeg" xml:id= "AM02-5000-1r"
url="AM02-5000-1r.jpg"/>
            <graphic mimeType="jpeg" url="AM02-5000-1r-thumb.jpg"
		     width="1in" decls="#thumb"/>
            <zone ulx="20" uly="20" lrx="70" lry="70">
            <graphic mimeType="jpeg" xml:id= "AM02-5000-1r-det"
url="AM02-5000-1r-det.jpg"/>
            </zone>
        </surface>
        <surface  start="#LSB-1v" ulx="0" uly="0" lrx="200" lry="300">
            <graphic mimeType="jpeg" xml:id= "AM02-5000-1v"
url="AM02-5000-1v.jgp"/>
            <graphic mimeType="jpeg" url="AM02-5000-1v-thumb.jpg" decls="http://www.enrich.org/imageDescs#thumb"/>
        </surface>
    </facsimile></egXML>
</p>
<p>The <att>xml:base</att> attribute specifies the <soCalled>root
URL</soCalled>, which will be prefixed to all URL values within the
child elements of this <gi>facsimile</gi>. </p>
<p>This example defines only two pages. There are three images
associated with the first page, which is
represented by the <gi>surface</gi> element with
unique identifier <val>LSB-1r</val>, and two with  the second, which has no
identifier. Each image is represented by means of a TEI
<gi>graphic</gi> element. </p>
<p>As well as acting as a container for the various images associated
with a page, the <gi>surface</gi> element defines an abstract
co-ordinate system which may be used when defining additional zones of
interest on the page. In this example, the location of an initial
letter on the page is defined, since we have a graphic representing
this detail. The zone within which the initial letter falls is in the
box defined by the co-ordinates (20,20,70,70) within a grid defined by
the co-ordinates (0,0,200,300). Thus, if the surface depicted
actually measured 200 by 300 mm, the initial letter would occupy a
50 X 50 mm square, with its upper left corner located 20 mm from the
left and 20 mm from the top edges of the surface. Note however that
the numbers used to express co-ordinates are not measurements in any
specific units and should not be used to determine the actual image
size, since these may in any case vary greatly: in our example, the
first image is a full page scan, while the second is a thumbnail.</p>
<p>The <att>mimeType</att> attribute is used to indicate the format of
the graphic file itself, and may be any valid MIME type, as defined by
the IANA, for example <val>jpeg</val>, <val>png</val>, <val>bmp</val>,
<val>tiff</val> etc. </p>
<p>The <att>decls</att> attribute is used to indicate an external URI
from which further metadata applicable to this image may be found. In
this case we are assuming that there is a definition which can be used
to indicate characteristics of a thumbnail image at the address
indicated. Note that this must be given in full, since it would
otherwise be interpreted as an address relative to the value of the
<att>xml:base</att> attribute on the parent <gi>facsimile</gi>.</p>
<note rend="query">Alternatively, should we invent a type-like attribute
which could be validated in the schema? </note>
<p>The <gi>desc</gi> element within a <gi>zone</gi> may be used to
supply additional information about that zone, in this example to
describe what it contains. In the TEI scheme, full documentation  of a
facsimile and its contents is carried in other parts of the digital
document, linked to it in either or both of the following ways:
<list>
<item>the <att>start</att> attribute may be used on a <gi>zone</gi> or
<gi>surface</gi>; it points to an element in the transcription the
start of which coincides with the zone or surface concerned.</item>
<item>the <att>facs</att> attribute may be used, for example on the
<gi>msContents</gi> or <gi>msItem</gi> element in a manuscript
description, or on any element in the transcription, to point to the
<gi>surface</gi> bearing the start of the matter in question. </item>
</list>
</p>
<p>To complete the above example, we might thus expect that the
<gi>msDesc</gi> for this manuscript will contain something like the
following:
<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<msItem>
    <locus facs="#LSB-1r">ff. 1r-1v</locus>
    <title>Ludovícuss saga Bernharðssonar</title>
</msItem>
</egXML>
Here, the value of the <att>facs</att> attribute is a
pointer to the <gi>surface</gi> element corresponding with the part of
the manuscript in which the <gi>msItem</gi> specified begins.

If a transcription of this (regrettably nonexistent) manuscript exists,
then it might begin as follows:

<egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
<div facs="#LSB-1r">
   <pb n="1r" />

       <!-- text for second page here -->
