     =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-12-15)

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
     JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, so the formal public 
     identifiers were changed in the modules and the catalogs.
     No model or attribute changes were made at this time. 
 
  8. JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"

     =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1d3             (DAL/BTU) v1.1d3  (2015-03-01)
   
     The changes in this release are in response to NISO 
     License and Indicators Recommended Practice.

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1d3 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
     
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.
  
  7. ERROR IN COMMENT FIXED
     The 'Typical Invocation' comment at the top of the document
     has an in correct fpi:
     "-//NLM//DTD JATS Namespaced OASIS XML Table Module v1.1d2 
      20140930//EN"
     comment was changed to the correct:
     "-//OASIS//DTD XML Exchange Table Model 19990315//EN"
 
  6. JATS became version "1.1d3" and "v1.1 20150301//EN"

     =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.1d2 (2014-09-30)
   
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
     
     This catalog represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.

  5. JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"
  
     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
   
     If approved by the voting members of NISO, this will become the
     Version 1.0 NISO JATS Z39.96-2012 NISO Standard. 
   
  4. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "1.0" and the formal
     public identifier to the date: "v1.0 20120330//EN".

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
  3. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
  2. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".

     =============================================================
     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov./3.0.

  1. Updated public identifier to "v3.0 20080202//EN"              -->

<!-- XML EXCHANGE TABLE MODEL DECLARATION MODULE -->

<!-- This set of declarations defines the XML version of the Exchange
     Table Model as of the date shown in the Formal Public Identifier
     (FPI) for this entity.

     This set of declarations may be referred to using a public external
     entity declaration and reference as shown in the following three
     lines-

     <!ENTITY % calstblx
       PUBLIC "-//OASIS//DTD XML Exchange Table Model 19990315//EN">
       %calstblx;

     If various parameter entities used within this set of declarations
     are to be given non-default values, the appropriate declarations
     should be given before calling in this package (i.e., before the
     "%calstblx;" reference).
-->

<!-- The motivation for this XML version of the Exchange Table Model
     is simply to create an XML version of the SGML Exchange Table
     Model. By design, no effort has been made to "improve" the model.

     This XML version incorporates the logical bare minimum changes
     necessary to make the Exchange Table Model a valid XML DTD.
-->

<!-- The XML version of the Exchange Table Model differs from
     the SGML version in the following ways-

     The following parameter entities have been removed-

       - tbl.table.excep, tbl.hdft.excep, tbl.row.excep, tbl.entry.excep
         There are no exceptions in XML. The following normative
         statement is made in lieu of exceptions- the exchange table model
         explicitly forbids a table from occurring within another table.
         If the content model of an entry includes a table element, then this
         cannot be enforced by the DTD, but it is a deviation from the
         exchange table model to include a table within a table.

       - tbl.hdft.name, tbl.hdft.mdl, tbl.hdft.excep, tbl.hdft.att
         The motivation for these elements was to change the table
         header/footer elements. Since XML does not allow element
         declarations to contain name groups, and the exchange table model
         does not allow a table to contain footers, the continued presence
         of these attributes seems unnecessary.

     The following parameter entity has been added-

       - tbl.thead.att
         This entity parameterizes the attributes on thead. It replaces
         the tbl.hdft.att parameter entity.

     Other miscellaneous changes-

       - Tag omission indicators have been removed
       - Comments have been removed from declarations
       - NUMBER attributes have been changed to NMTOKEN
       - NUTOKEN attributes have been to changed to NMTOKEN
       - Removed the grouping characters around the content model
         parameter entry for the 'entry' element. This is necessary
         so that an entry can contain #PCDATA and be defined as an
         optional, repeatable OR group beginning with #PCDATA.
-->

<!-- This entity includes a set of element and attribute declarations
     that partially defines the Exchange table model.  However, the
     model is not well-defined without the accompanying natural language
     description of the semantics (meanings) of these various elements,
     attributes, and attribute values.  The semantic writeup, also
     available from SGML Open, should be used in conjunction with this entity.
-->

<!-- In order to use the Exchange table model, various parameter entity
     declarations are required.  A brief description is as follows-

     This set of declarations will use the default definitions shown below
     for any of these parameter entities that are not declared before this
     set of declarations is referenced.
-->

<!-- These definitions are not directly related to the table model, but are
     used in the default CALS table model and may be defined elsewhere (and
     prior to the inclusion of this table module) in the referencing DTD. -->

<!ENTITY % yesorno 'NMTOKEN'> <!-- no if zero(s), yes if any other value -->
<!ENTITY % titles  'title?'>
<!ENTITY % paracon '#PCDATA'>
<!-- default for use in entry content -->

<!--
The parameter entities as defined below change and simplify the CALS
table model as published (as part of the Example DTD) in MIL-HDBK-28001.
The resulting simplified DTD has support from the SGML Open vendors and is
therefore more interoperable among different systems.

These following declarations provide the Exchange default definitions
for these entities.  However, these entities can be redefined (by giving
the appropriate parameter entity declaration(s) prior to the reference
to this Table Model declaration set entity) to fit the needs of the
current application.

Note, however, that changes may have significant effect on the ability
to interchange table information.  These changes may manifest themselves
in usability, presentation, and possible structure information
degradation.
