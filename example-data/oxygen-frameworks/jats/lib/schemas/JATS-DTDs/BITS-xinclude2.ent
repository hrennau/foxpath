     JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-12-15)

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
     JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, and BITS modified to use
     the most recent version. No other changes to BITS were made.
 
  6. BITS remained version "2.0" but became "v2.0 20151225"
     JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"

    =============================================================
     BITS Version 2.0              (DAL/BTU) v2.0  (2015-03-15)
     JATS Version 1.1              (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-03-01)

     BITS was modified, based on user feedback collected in 2014 
     and January/February 2015, according to the decisions
     made by the BITS Working Group. This DTD represents current 
     BITS and an interim version of the non-normative JATS DTD 
     Suite (version 1.1), as an indication to JATS users of 
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. 

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.

  5. BITS became version "2.0" and   "v2.0 20150630"
     JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20150301"

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.

     This catalog represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users

                        an <xi:include> element. It provides a
                        mechanism for recovering from missing
                        resources. When a resource error is
                        encountered, the <xi:include> element is
                        replaced with the contents of the
                        <xi:fallback> element. If the <xi:fallback>
                        element is empty, the <xi:include> element is
                        removed from the result." Since it is not the
                        business of this Tag Set to specify
                        processing, the <xi:fallback> element will
                        default to #PCDATA, but the parameter entity
                        %fallback-model; can be redefined in the
                        customization of any user organization that
                        desires a different fallback result.
