     =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-12-15)

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
     JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, so the formal public 
     identifiers were changed in the modules and the catalogs.
     No model or attribute changes were made at this time. 
 
 14. JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"

      =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1d3             (DAL/BTU) v1.1d3  (2015-03-01)
   
     The changes in this release are in response to NISO 
     License and Indicators Recommended Practice.

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1d3 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
     
     This draft DTD represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.

 13. JATS became version "1.1d3" and "v1.1 20150301//EN"

     =============================================================
     JATS Version 1.1d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.1d2 (2014-09-30)
   
     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which 
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.
     
     This catalog represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.

  12. JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"

     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.1d1           (DAL/BTU) v1.1 (2013-11-15)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (pre-release for V1.0 BITS; Version 1.1d1) 

     NISO JATS Standing Committee met and answered the requests and
     suggestions from the NISO request forms.

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/

 11. INSTITUTION WRAP ADDED
     Added the elements <institution-wrap> to the following elements
     through the institution-wrap.class:
      - funding-source

 10. GLOBAL ATTRIBUTES - Added the new parameter entity 
         %jats-common-atts;
     to every element in this module. This PE adds (for now) the
     @id attribute and the @xml:base attribute to every element,
     whether metadata or narrative.
     Since the @id in this parameter entity is optional, a second
     parameter entity jats-common-atts-id-required was also added.
     The two are kept in sync with the jats-base-atts parameter 
     entity.

     =============================================================
     NISO JATS Version 1.0             (DAL/BTU) v1.0 (2012-xx-xx)
   
     ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 (Version 1.0) 

     Details concerning ANSI/NISO Z39.96-2012 JATS-based DTDs,  
     XSDs, RNGs and supporting documentation are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/1.0/

  9. PRINCIPAL-AWARD-RECIPIENT MODEL - Added "contrib-id.class" to 
     the <principal-award-recipient> through 
     principal-award-recipient-elements, to hold identifiers for 
     people, such as publishers-specific IDs, ORCIDs, etc..

  8. PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR MODEL - Added "contrib-id.class" to 
     the <principal-investigator> through 
     principal-investigator-elements, to hold identifiers for 
     people, such as publishers-specific IDs, ORCIDs, etc..
   
  7. Updated the public identifier to "v1.0 20120330//EN", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "1".

     =============================================================
     Version 0.4                       (DAL/BTU) v0.4 (2011-01-31)
   
     This Tag Set is in the process of becoming a NISO standard.
     The version numbers are starting over from 0.4", as a Trial
     Use Draft, to be made into "Version 1.0" when the Tag Suite 
     becomes a NISO standard. Thus, the version number that would
     have been "NLM Version 3.1 Draft" has become NISO JATS
     "Version 0.4".

     Details on NISO Trial Use Draft Version 0.4 are available at
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/JATS-0.4.
   
  6. Updated the DTD-version attribute to "0.4" 
   
  5. Updated the public identifier to "v0.4 20110131", 
     modified the formal public identifier to include "JATS (Z39.96)",
     and the filename as delivered to include "JATS" and the
     new version number "0".
           http://jats.nlm.nih.gov/0.4.

  4. FUNDING GROUP- Allowed <open-access> to repeat within
     <funding-group>

  3. @SPECIFIC-USE and @XML:LANG - Added the @specific-use and
     @xml:lang to the following elements:

      - award-group through award-group-atts (both)
      - award-id through award-id-atts (both)
      - funding-group through funding-group-atts (both) NEW PE
      - funding-source through funding-source-atts (both)
      - funding-statement through funding-statement-atts (both)
      - open-access through open-access-atts (both) NEW PE
      - principal-award-recipient through
          principal-award-recipient-atts (both) NEW PE
      - principal-investigator through principal-investigator-atts
          (both) NEW PE

  2. OPEN ACCESS MODEL - Changed the model from
         "(p+)"
     to
          "(%just-para.class;+)"

     =============================================================
     Version 3.0                       (DAL/BTU) v3.0 (2007-10-31)

     Version 3.0 is the first non-backward-compatible release.
     In addition to the usual incremental changes, some
     elements and attributes have been renamed and/or remodeled
     to better meet user needs and to increase tag set consistency.
     All module change histories are available through the Tag Suite
     web site at http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov.

     Details on version 3.0 are available at
           http://dtd.nlm.nih.gov/3.0.
