    =============================================================
     BITS Version 2.0                (DAL/BTU) v2.0  (2015-12-25)
     JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-12-15)

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
     JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, and BITS modified to use
     the most recent version. No other changes to BITS were made.
 
  5. BITS remained version "2.0" but became "v2.0 20151225"
     JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"

    =============================================================
     BITS Version 2.0                (DAL/BTU) v2.0  (2015-03-15)
     JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-03-01)

     BITS was modified, based on user feedback collected in 2014 
     and January/February 2015, according to the decisions
     made by the BITS Working Group. This DTD represents current 
     BITS and an interim version of the non-normative JATS DTD 
     Suite (version 1.1), as an indication to JATS users of 
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. 

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.

  4. ALI NAMESPACE - Added the ali: namespace to the attributes 
     for <book-app>, <book-app-group>, and <book-part>.

  3. BOOK APPENDIX AND BOOK APPENDIX GROUP
      - New element Book Appendix (<book-app>), a 
        book-part-level appendix structure.

      - New element Book Appendix Group (<book-app-group>), a 
        book-part-level appendix grouping structure.

      These new components are only used in tthe back matter
      for a whole book (<book-back>).

  2. BITS became version "2.0" and   "v2.0 20150630"
     JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20150301"

     =============================================================
     BITS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1    (2014-09-30)
     JATS Version 1.1d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.1d2  (2014-09-30)

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.

     This catalog represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.

  2. BOOK APPENDIX - Added a new named book-part <book-app>,
     that can be used in the back matter of books. It takes the
     full book-part model and attributes.

  1. BITS became version "1.1" and   "v1.1 20140930//EN"
     JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"

                        Remarks: BITS is deliberately agnostic
                        concerning the definition of a book series
                        or a book set, leaving the question of
                        definition to the publisher.

                        book, which is not included as part of the

                        reference tables, special glossaries, or an
                        explanation of applications and software in
                        a book on theory.
                          A <book-app> may be a very large book

                        Related Elements: This element is similar to 
                        (but not the same as) the JATS appendix
                        element (<app>). An appendix (<app>) is part
                        of a book part such as a chapter or a JATS 
                        article and is placed into the back matter
                        (<back>) of that chapter. A Book Appendix 
                        (<book-app>) is an appendix that is a
                        book-part-level component of a book, and 
                        is found in the back matter of the whole 
                        book (<book-back>) rather than within the
                        back matter of a single book-part (<back>).
