    =============================================================
     BITS Version 2.0                (DAL/BTU) v2.0  (2015-12-25)
     JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-12-15)

     JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the ANSI and NISO memberships to be changed. 
     JATS 1.1 was approved in late 2015, and BITS modified to use
     the most recent version. No other changes to BITS were made.
 
  5. BITS remained version "2.0" but became "v2.0 20151225"
     JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20151215"

    =============================================================
     BITS Version 2.0                (DAL/BTU) v2.0  (2015-03-15)
     JATS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1  (2015-03-01)

     BITS was modified, based on user feedback collected in 2014 
     and January/February 2015, according to the decisions
     made by the BITS Working Group. This DTD represents current 
     BITS and an interim version of the non-normative JATS DTD 
     Suite (version 1.1), as an indication to JATS users of 
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee. 

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.

  4. ANSWER-SPECIFIC PARAGRAPH-LEVEL OBJECTS
     Created a new PE (answer-para-level) to prohibit 
     <explanation> at the paragraph level inside
     <answer>, because that created DTD determinism problems.

  3. BOOK APPENDIX AND BOOK APPENDIX GROUP
     Changed the entity book-parts-mix to include the new
     book-level appendix and appendix group elements
     (<book-app> and <book-app.group>), so it WILL NOT LONGER
     contain the book-part-level appendices (<app> and
     <app-group>).

  2. BITS became version "2.0" and   "v2.0 20150630"
     JATS became version "1.1" and "v1.1 20150301"

     =============================================================
     BITS Version 1.1                (DAL/BTU) v1.1    (2014-09-30)
     JATS Version 1.1d2              (DAL/BTU) v1.1d2  (2014-09-30)

     NISO JATS is a continuing maintenance NISO Standard, which
     requires voting by the NISO membership to be changed. This
     Committee Draft 1.1d2 will be sent to the NISO voting
     membership, to become (if approved) NISO JATS 1.1.

     This catalog represents an interim version of the
     non-normative JATS DTD Suite, as an indication to JATS users
     the decisions that have been made by the JATS Standing
     Committee.

  1. BITS became version "1.1" and   "v1.1 20140930//EN"
     JATS became version "1.1d2" and "v1.1d2 20140930//EN"

                        Inline elements appear only inside a

                        paragraph or at the same level as a
                        paragraph. This serves a requirement in a
                        repository DTD, since some incoming material
                        will have restricted such elements to only

                        will have restricted them to only outside a
                        paragraph and some may allow them in both
                        places. Thus the DTD must allow for them to
                        be in either or both.                      -->
