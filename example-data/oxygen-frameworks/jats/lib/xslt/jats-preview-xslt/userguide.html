            <p id="d2e27">The NISO JATS 1.0 Preview Stylesheets package includes stylesheets that produce formatted
               previews of documents encoded in XML using the NISO JATS (Journal Article Tag Suite)
               vocabulary. Previews in both HTML and PDF format (via XSL-FO) are supported. Most
               generic
               Journal Publishing structures are supported, subject to the assumptions and limitations
               described in this document.
            </p>
            <p id="d2e29">The primary purpose of the stylesheets is to support version 1.0 of the Publishing
               ("blue")
               tag set of NISO JATS, but they will also work on data valid to the related tag sets
               JATS 1.0
               Authoring ("orange") and NLM Journal Publishing ("blue") or Authoring ("orange") versions
               2.3 and 3.0.
            </p>
            <p id="d2e31">The documentation included in this package, namely this <i>Users' Guide</i>, the
               <i>Quick Start Guide</i>, and the <i>Technical Documentation</i>, can
               serve as examples of the tagging style supported; they are all encoded in NISO JATS
               Publishing XML, with HTML and PDF presentation versions generated using the preview
               stylesheets.
            </p>
            <p id="d2e42">Assuming the user already has valid JATS (Publishing) 1.0 data, the most important
               consideration regarding application of these stylesheets regards the format of bibliographic
               citation information in the input and the bibliographic format desired for those citations
               in the output. Citations tagged using <tt>mixed-citation</tt> and provided
               with appropriate punctuation in the input (called here "formatted citations") are
               handled
               correctly by the stylesheets in this package. Citations tagged without punctuation,
               using
               <tt>element-citation</tt> ("unformatted citations") can also be handled:
               this distribution includes stylesheets which format such citations in the user's choice
               of
               two formats: NLM/Pubmed, and APA.
            </p>
            <p id="d2e50">In addition, this package also demonstrates how pre- and post-processing steps connected
               together in pipelines may achieve other processing goals, both preview and production.
               These
               include processing OASIS (CALS) tables and handling tagging intended to optimize outputs
               for
               different media (such as web and print).
            </p>
            <p id="d2e52">For a more precise description of the technical dependencies of these stylesheets,
               along
               with documentation of alternative ways to deploy and apply them and of how to extend
               and
               modify them, users should consult the <i>Technical Documentation</i>. That
               document also includes a fuller specification of the formatted and unformatted citation
               formats supported by this package.

                     (it is
                     anchored to its place in the flow of text); similarly a boxed text may be allowed
                     to
                     float, or it may be anchored, depending on whether its exact placement on the page
                     is
                     important to its meaning. But the term is also used to refer to objects (such as figures
                     and tables) that are encoded in the source data -- but not necessarily rendered --
                     apart
                     from the flow of the text, typically by gathering them into a group at the end of
                     the
                     document. Such "floating" objects may be displayed there, or moved by the application
                     to
                     fixed (anchored) positions, or allowed to "float" in the first sense.

                  <p id="d2e760">The Journal Publishing model supports either of two general approaches to encoding
                     footnotes in valid data. The <tt>fn</tt> element may be used in line where
                     a reference to a footnote (generally the first or only reference) should appear, with
                     the footnote content moved in rendering (typically to the bottom of the page). Or
                     footnotes may be encoded together in a structured grouping, the
                     <tt>fn-group</tt> element, and footnote references in the text are
                     encoded with <tt>xref</tt> elements, like any other cross-reference. The
                     latter style of encoding is said in the Journal Publishing documentation to be
                     appropriate for "end notes" as opposed to footnotes as such.
                     <tt>fn-group</tt> is permitted in a number of places, including within
                     the article back matter and in several other locations where footnotes are commonly
                     grouped in journal articles.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d2e774">These stylesheets will support either approach to encoding footnotes. In the HTML
                     preview output, all footnotes encoded inline are grouped together in a section called
                     "Notes" appearing at the end of the document. In the PDF, footnotes encoded inline
                     are
                     formatted at the foot of the page. In both cases, footnotes grouped in
                     <tt>fn-group</tt> or in <tt>author-notes</tt> appear
                     collected together where the <tt>fn-group</tt> or
                     <tt>author-notes</tt> appears. This will usually be inside the back
                     matter, but it can also occur in other places such as in the front matter,
                     <tt>boxed-text</tt> or <tt>table-wrap-foot</tt>.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d2e795">Note that the two approaches (loose <tt>fn</tt> elements and
                     <tt>fn</tt> within <tt>fn-group</tt>) may be combined, but
                     this is inadvisable unless footnotes are numbered in the data, since it may result
                     in
                     two distinct sets of footnote numbering. It is best to encode footnotes all one way
                     or
                     all the other. Generally, if you use <tt>fn</tt> elements within mixed
                     content, do not also use <tt>fn-group</tt>. If you use
                     <tt>fn-group</tt>, use it for all footnotes and use
                     <tt>xref</tt> to provide references to them.
                  </p>
                  <p id="d2e819">Additionally, in the PDF preview, errors will result if inline footnotes appear inside
                     floating objects (such as boxed text or figures). This is because the XSL-FO formatter
                     cannot position both a footnote and a floating object together (since when a footnote
                     is
                     moved to appear on the same page as a float, the page layout determining where the
                     float
                     can be placed may also be thrown off). This restriction means, in effect, that if
                     you
                     have footnotes in your floating objects, you must locate the footnotes inside an
                     <tt>fn-group</tt>, and reference them with <tt>xref</tt>,
                     rather than using <tt>fn</tt> elements inline.

                  labels automatically.<a href="#d2e846"><span class="generated">[5]</span></a> If figures, tables and similar structures such as statements, supplementary
                  material, etc. are to be labelled, they must be labelled in the data. Labels provided
                  in
                  the data (<tt>label</tt> elements) are displayed with the elements they
                  label; the same label content also appears in cross-references that point to those
                  elements when a cross-reference element (<tt>xref</tt> element) is given as
                  empty. (When an <tt>xref</tt> element has text content, it is used as the
                  text of the cross-reference, irrespective of whether a label appears with its target.)
               </p>
               <p id="d2e863">This approach is meant to be as transparent and easy to understand as possible: rather
                  than assume any autolabeling method and format, it assumes that when labels are wanted
                  on
                  content, they will be provided explicitly in the source data, and that when a
                  cross-reference is made to an object, it will either have content of its own (which
                  can
                  serve as anchoring text), or its target will have an explicit label that can be used
                  unaltered as the text in the cross-reference.
               </p>
               <p id="d2e865">There are two exceptions to this principle: numbering is provided for footnotes
                  (<tt>fn</tt> elements) and for references (<tt>ref</tt>
                  elements) when they do not have explicit labels, as these elements' primary purpose
                  is
                  their systematic cross-referencing, and in most instances they will not function without
                  labels. In both cases, explicit labels (<tt>label</tt> elements or, in the
                  case of footnotes, <tt>symbol</tt> attributes) will override autogenerated
                  labels, allowing for projects to control these values in their data when necessary.
               </p>
               <p id="d2e879">In all cases, to ensure legible and transparent output, warning messages may be generated
                  for unlabelled elements where labels are needed (due to an empty cross-reference pointing
                  to the element). This is described further below.
               </p>
               <p id="d2e881">When generated for footnotes and references, automated numbers are assigned based
                  on the
                  order of their appearance in the document, not of first references to them. (Nor are
                  <tt>ref</tt> elements sorted to reflect their order of first reference.)
                  Accordingly, in the PDF output, since footnotes are placed based on the location of
                  the
                  <tt>fn</tt> element in the document, a cross-reference can be made to a
                  footnote that will appear on a different page. This also means that if footnote A
                  appears
                  before footnote B in the document, a reference to footnote B will appear out of sequence
                  if it appears before footnote A does. The easiest ways to avoid both these problems
                  are
                  (a) to use footnotes as endnotes (group them in <tt>fn-group</tt> in the
                  back matter) and confirm that they are placed in order of first reference; or (b)
                  use
                  inline footnotes consistently (resulting in actual footnotes in the PDF) and make
                  sure
                  that in every case, an <tt>fn</tt> element appears <i>before</i>
                  any other (second or subsequent) reference to the same footnote.
               </p>
               <p id="d2e898">These stylesheets do not accommodate a practice of redundant tagging, whereby a footnote
                  encoded inline is also provided with an <tt>xref</tt> (cross-reference)
                  element to that footnote. If an <tt>fn</tt> element is used in line, a
                  reference will appear for it. Cross-references to footnotes should be used only for
                  end
                  notes (<tt>fn</tt> elements in <tt>fn-group</tt>) or in cases
                  where more than one reference is made to a single footnote.

                                 placed inline at their point of first reference.

                              <p id="d2e933">Avoid using (empty) <tt>xref</tt> elements to refer to footnotes

               in
               their handling of citations (which cannot be handled generically), this is recommended
               only
               when citation formatting is otherwise accounted for.
