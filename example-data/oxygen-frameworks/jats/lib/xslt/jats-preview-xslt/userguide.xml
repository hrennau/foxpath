      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The NISO JATS 1.0 Preview Stylesheets package includes stylesheets that produce formatted
        previews of documents encoded in XML using the NISO JATS (Journal Article Tag Suite)
        vocabulary. Previews in both HTML and PDF format (via XSL-FO) are supported. Most generic
        Journal Publishing structures are supported, subject to the assumptions and limitations
        described in this document.</p>
      <p>The primary purpose of the stylesheets is to support version 1.0 of the Publishing ("blue")
        tag set of NISO JATS, but they will also work on data valid to the related tag sets JATS 1.0
        Authoring ("orange") and NLM Journal Publishing ("blue") or Authoring ("orange") versions
        2.3 and 3.0.</p>
      <p>The documentation included in this package, namely this <italic>Users' Guide</italic>, the
          <italic>Quick Start Guide</italic>, and the <italic>Technical Documentation</italic>, can
        serve as examples of the tagging style supported; they are all encoded in NISO JATS
        Publishing XML, with HTML and PDF presentation versions generated using the preview
        stylesheets.</p>
      <p>Assuming the user already has valid JATS (Publishing) 1.0 data, the most important
        consideration regarding application of these stylesheets regards the format of bibliographic
        citation information in the input and the bibliographic format desired for those citations
        in the output. Citations tagged using <monospace>mixed-citation</monospace> and provided
        with appropriate punctuation in the input (called here "formatted citations") are handled
        correctly by the stylesheets in this package. Citations tagged without punctuation, using
          <monospace>element-citation</monospace> ("unformatted citations") can also be handled:
        this distribution includes stylesheets which format such citations in the user's choice of
        two formats: NLM/Pubmed, and APA.</p>
      <p>In addition, this package also demonstrates how pre- and post-processing steps connected
        together in pipelines may achieve other processing goals, both preview and production. These
        include processing OASIS (CALS) tables and handling tagging intended to optimize outputs for
        different media (such as web and print).</p>
      <p>For a more precise description of the technical dependencies of these stylesheets, along
        with documentation of alternative ways to deploy and apply them and of how to extend and
        modify them, users should consult the <italic>Technical Documentation</italic>. That
        document also includes a fuller specification of the formatted and unformatted citation
        formats supported by this package.</p>

      <title>Getting started</title>
      <p>To select which stylesheet to use, you will first need to determine the following:<list
          list-type="order">
          <list-item>
            <p>If you have unformatted citations in your input, do you want the output to be in
              NLM/Pubmed format or APA format? (These are the only formats these stylesheets can
              produce from unformatted citations in the input.)</p>
            <p>If all the citations in the input are formatted, you can use either the NLM/Pubmed or
              the APA stylesheets and pipelines mentioned below.</p>
            <p>If you have no citations or if your citations contain only simple inline tagging with punctuation,<fn>
                <p>As described in the <italic>Technical Documentation</italic> under "Simple
                  citation" format.</p>
              </fn> you can forego citation formatting altogether.</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Do you want HTML (with CSS), or PDF?</p>
          </list-item>
          <list-item>
            <p>Which of the following methods do you prefer to use for processing the input? <list>
                <list-item>
                  <p>An XProc (XML Pipelining) processor such as XML Calabash?</p>
                  <p>If using XProc, you will select a pipeline specification from the
                      <monospace>shells/xproc</monospace> subdirectory.</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>A copy of Saxon that supports the necessary extension functions?<fn
                      id="saxon-versions">
                      <p>Since version 9.2, the open-source version of Saxon (Saxon HE) does not
                        support the needed extension function, so you will need Saxon PE or EE.
                        Before version 9.2, the extension functions required by the Saxon shell
                        stylesheets was available in versions of Saxon back to 8.9.</p>
                    </fn></p>
                  <p>If using Saxon, you will select a shell stylesheet from the
                      <monospace>shells/saxon</monospace> subdirectory.</p>
                </list-item>
                <list-item>
                  <p>A different XSLT processor?</p>
                  <p>Only the Saxon pipelines require Saxon; the stylesheets themselves will work in
                    any conformant XSLT processor. Many of the stylesheets are in XSLT 1.0 and will
                    work in a 1.0 processor (or 2.0) processor; some require XSLT 2.0.<fn>
                      <p>Consult the <italic>Technical Documentation</italic> for details on which
                        stylesheets require XSLT 2.0. (Apart from the Saxon shell stylesheets, most
                        do not.)</p>
                    </fn> You can run pipelines either "by hand" (run several stylesheets each on
                    the results of the previous one) or using a custom-built pipelining method
                    (shell or batch script, Java Ant, <monospace>make</monospace>, etc.). If you
                    don't need to run a pipeline, you can also run XSLT 1.0 stylesheets (such as the
                    HTML Preview stylesheet) in a web browser that supports XSLT 1.0.</p>

                    <monospace>shells/saxon/jats-PMCcit-html.xsl</monospace>.</p>
                <p>If you are running without Saxon or XProc, you will first apply
                    <monospace>xslt/citations-prep/jats-PMCcit.xsl</monospace> to your input, and
                  then apply <monospace>xslt/main/jats-html.xsl</monospace> to the output of the

                    <monospace>shells/saxon/jats-APAcit-html.xsl</monospace>. Since the APA citation
                  style transformation requires XSLT 2.0, you will need an XSLT 2.0 processor to run
                  it without Saxon or XProc. </p>

      <title>Advanced options</title>
      <p>In addition to the straightforward application of formatting to Journal Publishing content
        using either of the supported bibliographic citation styles, this suite of stylesheets
        supports a number of advanced options. While these can be used "out of the box", they are
        also included as demonstrations of how processes may be further tailored and customized to
        meet local requirements.</p>
      <p>In order to learn more, see the section on <xref rid="special-purpose">Special-purpose
          stylesheets</xref> below, along with the <italic>Technical Documentation</italic>.</p>

      <title>Assumptions made by the preview processing</title>
      <p>These stylesheets are designed to handle a broad range of inputs, generally requiring only
        that input data be XML valid to the NLM/NCBI Journal Publishing 3.0 DTD. Inevitably,
        however, there are limitations in their handling of of variant patterns of tagging and of
        structures that are valid but unlikely and/or poorly controlled by a schema.</p>
      <p>Caution: while these stylesheets do their best to handle "normal" input, <italic>they
          should not be taken as an indicator of a norm</italic>. "Variant" here does not
        necessarily mean "incorrect", and where local practice has evolved to meet particular local
        processing requirements, these stylesheets may <italic>and should</italic> be altered or
        extended to accommodate local practice and requirements.</p>
      <p>The remainder of this section outlines the main limitations of the stylesheets and the
        major assumptions they make about their input, grouping the entries into sections on <xref
          rid="limits">known limitations</xref>; <xref rid="autonumbering">autonumbering, labels,
          and cross-references</xref>; and <xref rid="citations">citations</xref>.</p>
      <sec id="limits">
        <title>Known limitations of these stylesheets</title>
        <p>Users should keep in mind that any and all of these behaviors and limitations (as well as
          those not described) can be addressed directly in customizations of these stylesheets;
          they are not inherent in XSLT (although sometimes the target format, HTML or XSL-FO,
          presents challenges), but only a result of the design requirement that the Preview
          stylesheets address the broadest possible set of "reasonable" approaches to tagging NISO
          JATS, without privileging any in particular.</p>
        <sec>
          <title>Running page headers</title>
          <p>The PDF preview stylesheet generates running headers using the main article title
              (<monospace>article-title</monospace> inside
              <monospace>article-meta/title-group</monospace>). If the main article title is too
            long, an alternative title can be provided for the page header; if available, an
              <monospace>alt-title</monospace> with <monospace>alt-title-type</monospace> of
            'running-head' will be used.</p>

          <p>On <monospace>sub</monospace> and <monospace>sup</monospace> elements the
              <monospace>arrange</monospace> attribute is not supported in either preview. All
            instances will be treated as <monospace>arrange='stagger'</monospace>.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Addresses</title>
          <p>The document model allows addresses (the <monospace>address</monospace> element) both
            as structured elements and within inline content such as paragraphs.</p>
          <p>Address elements inside <monospace>aff</monospace> (affiliation) are always formatted
            in line.</p>
          <p>If the address contains no <monospace>address-line</monospace> elements
              <italic>and</italic> it appears in paragraph content (that is, directly within

              <monospace>collab</monospace>, <monospace>named-content</monospace> and
              <monospace>styled-content</monospace> elements), then it is formatted in line. </p>
          <p>Otherwise, the address is formatted as blocks broken into separate lines, one for each
            element in the address.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Sub-articles</title>
          <p>The HTML preview stylesheet includes code for handling sub-articles, including the
            elements <monospace>sub-article</monospace> and <monospace>response</monospace>. Because
            the Journal Publishing tag set allows a wide range of ways to deploy and manage such
            content, particularly with respect to metadata and ancillary materials such as
            references and footnotes, these features have not been fully tested. If you have
              <monospace>sub-article</monospace> or <monospace>response</monospace> content,
            extending one or both stylesheets in view of your particular tagging patterns and
            requirements will probably be necessary.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Section metadata</title>
          <p>The same thing is true of section-level metadata (<monospace>sec-meta</monospace>),
            particularly with respect to the <monospace>contrib-group</monospace> element inside
              <monospace>sec-meta</monospace>. </p>
          <p>Also, within <monospace>sec-meta</monospace> in the PDF preview, only simple keywords
              (<monospace>kwd</monospace>) within <monospace>kwd-group</monospace> will be rendered;
              <monospace>compound-kwd</monospace> is ignored by these stylesheets.</p>
          <p>Test the stylesheets against your content and be prepared to amend the stylesheets, if

          <p>Graphics are not resized in the HTML preview, but displayed at native resolution; this
            may result in disproportionately large images when the images have been made large to
            give them higher resolution. In the PDF preview, images will be scaled down (as
            necessary) to fit in available space.</p>
          <p>In the HTML preview, graphics are expected to be located as given in the source data
            relative to the HTML <italic>result</italic> file. So, if source data has a graphic with
              <monospace>xlink:href='snapshots/babypic.jpg'</monospace>, the result file will link
            to 'snapshots/babypic.jpg'. If graphic files are maintained relative to the source data,
            they should either be copied to the same location relative to the result, or else an
            absolute path to the graphic should be given as the value, or (most simply) the HTML
            result file should be placed next to the XML source file, in order to ensure that
            graphics will be visible in the browser.</p>
          <p>In the PDF preview, a runtime parameter, <monospace>base-dir</monospace>, must be given
            to identify the directory relative to which graphics are located. If the XSL process is
            initiated using one of the provided XSLT 2.0 shell stylesheets, this parameter will be
            provided automatically as the base directory of the source file, so graphics should be
            located relative to the source data. If no parameter is given, then either graphics must
            be designated with absolute path names, or else they must be located relative to the
              <italic>stylesheet</italic>.</p>
          <p>Alternative text provided as <monospace>alt-text</monospace> on graphics is not
            rendered in the PDF preview.</p>

          <title>Styled content and the HTML <monospace>style</monospace> attribute</title>
          <p>The Journal Publishing document model makes provision for styling content directly by
            using CSS styles, either associated with table elements (HTML table elements in this
            model) or as the value given the <monospace>style</monospace> attribute of the
              <monospace>styled-content</monospace> inline element.</p>
          <p>When this appears, the HTML preview stylesheet will simply pass the values through.
            Results will depend on the level of CSS conformance in the browser and in the CSS values
            passed through to the output.</p>
          <p>In the PDF preview, <monospace>width</monospace> and
              <monospace>vertical-align</monospace> values associated with tables are mapped to
            formatting in the result. On any element with the <monospace>style</monospace>
            attribute, values of the following properties are mapped: <monospace>color</monospace>;
              <monospace>background-color</monospace>; <monospace>font-size</monospace>;
              <monospace>font-weight</monospace>; <monospace>font-style</monospace>;
              <monospace>font-family</monospace>; <monospace>text-decoration</monospace>. Note that
            incorrect CSS values may result in errors when XSL-FO stylesheet results are
            formatted.</p>
          <p>Note in particular that CSS properties related to borders are not supported in the PDF
            preview. For table cell borders, some bordering behavior can be specified using
            attributes on the <monospace>table</monospace> element.</p>

              *-->
          <p>In the parlance of document markup, "floating" can refer to two distinct things. If a
            rendering application is trusted, at runtime, to determine (and presumably optimize) the
            precise position on the page of an object, this object is said to "float". A figure, for
            example, may be allowed to float, while a graphic appearing in a paragraph is not (it is
            anchored to its place in the flow of text); similarly a boxed text may be allowed to
            float, or it may be anchored, depending on whether its exact placement on the page is
            important to its meaning. But the term is also used to refer to objects (such as figures
            and tables) that are encoded in the source data -- but not necessarily rendered -- apart
            from the flow of the text, typically by gathering them into a group at the end of the
            document. Such "floating" objects may be displayed there, or moved by the application to
            fixed (anchored) positions, or allowed to "float" in the first sense.</p>
          <p>The first feature in JATS tagging is controlled through the use of
              <monospace>position</monospace> attributes on objects that may be placed in this way
            by the formatter. These elements include <monospace>boxed-text</monospace>,
              <monospace>chem-struct-wrap</monospace>, <monospace>fig</monospace>,
              <monospace>fig-group</monospace>, <monospace>graphic</monospace>,
              <monospace>media</monospace>, <monospace>preformat</monospace>,
              <monospace>supplementary-material</monospace>, <monospace>table-wrap</monospace>,
              <monospace>table-wrap-group</monospace>. The second feature is supported by means of
            the <monospace>floats-group</monospace> element, where such objects may be gathered.</p>
          <p>Note that <monospace>position='float'</monospace> may be assigned to any of these
            objects irrespective of whether it is gathered into <monospace>floats-group</monospace>.
            Similarly, it is possible (although not ordinary) for an object to be placed inside
              <monospace>floats-group</monospace>, and not in the body of the document, without
            assigning it <monospace>position='float'</monospace>.</p>
          <p>Note also that by default, on all these objects, <monospace>position</monospace> is
            assigned a value of 'float' by the Journal Publishing DTD. If the attribute is not set
            in the data, the formatting stylesheets assume the value 'float', both out of respect
            for the semantics specified by the formal document model, and in order to prevent
            different formatting when the DTD is used from when it is not.</p>
          <p>Any object assigned <monospace>position='float'</monospace> will be allowed to float on
            the page. Exceptions to this rule include the following:<list>
              <list-item>
                <p>No object, even one set to float, will float if it appears inside another object
                  set to float. Note again that objects are set to float implicitly, unless position
                  is set to 'anchor' or 'margin'.</p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p><monospace>graphic</monospace> and <monospace>media</monospace> will not float
                  when they appear inside any of the other elements that could float, even if they
                  don't in fact float. (For example: a <monospace>graphic</monospace> inside a
                    <monospace>fig</monospace> will not float, even if its
                    <monospace>position</monospace> is set to float and even if the
                    <monospace>fig</monospace> does not float.)</p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p><monospace>fig</monospace> will not float inside <monospace>fig-group</monospace>
                  (though the <monospace>fig-group</monospace> may float).</p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p><monospace>table-wrap</monospace> will not float inside
                    <monospace>table-wrap-group</monospace> (though the group as a whole may
                  float).</p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p><monospace>preformat</monospace> will not float inside
                  <monospace>bio</monospace>, <monospace>boxed-text</monospace>,
                    <monospace>chem-struct</monospace>, <monospace>chem-struct-wrap</monospace>,
                    <monospace>disp-formula</monospace>, <monospace>disp-quote</monospace>,
                    <monospace>fig</monospace>, <monospace>glossary</monospace>,
                    <monospace>supplementary-material</monospace>,
                    <monospace>disp-formula</monospace>, or <monospace>table-wrap</monospace>. Note,
                  however, that like other floatable objects, <monospace>preformat</monospace> will
                  ordinarily float unless its position says not to!</p>
              </list-item>
            </list></p>
          <p>Also, the value 'margin' is not supported; objects with
              <monospace>position='margin'</monospace> will act as if they have
              <monospace>position='anchor'</monospace>.</p>
          <p>In the HTML preview, floating an object will not move it on the page; it will only
            allow text to flow around it.</p>
          <p>In the PDF preview, objects with <monospace>position='float'</monospace> will be
            positioned on the page by the formatting engine, typically at the top of the same page
            where the object would appear if its <monospace>position</monospace> were 'anchor'. The
            exact placement will depend on the formatting engine.</p>
          <p>Note that when a float group is large (e.g. a table with footnotes provided both in
            table form and as a graphic), it may not all fit on a single page.</p>
          <p>Where floating is not wanted, the easiest solution is to set
              <monospace>position</monospace> to 'anchor' on the element.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Gathering objects in <monospace>floats-group</monospace></title>
          <p>Just like objects elsewhere, the placement of objects tagged inside
              <monospace>floats-group</monospace> is determined by their
              <monospace>position</monospace> attribute. The difference is that when assigned
              <monospace>position='float'</monospace> (and remember this is the value by default),
            in the PDF preview the object is formatted near its first cross-reference. Otherwise,
            and when no such cross-reference appears in the document, it is formatted at the end of
            the document.</p>
          <p>The HTML preview stylesheet displays all objects inside
              <monospace>floats-group</monospace> at the end of the document. (In this case,
            however, cross-references are also hyperlinked.)</p>
          <p>When articles should be formatted with a "Figures" or "Tables" section at the end, an
              <monospace>app</monospace> or <monospace>sec</monospace> should be used for this
            purpose, and the objects anchored in place. The preview stylesheets assume that
              <monospace>floats-group</monospace> is specifically for collecting objects that are
            intended to be formatted elsewhere.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Correct numbering of floating objects</title>
          <p>As described below, the preview stylesheets do not provide automated numbering for
            floating objects (distinguished, as a class, from footnotes, which may also "float"). In
            systems where the stylesheet is extended to provide autonumbering, rules will need to be
            formulated and followed to govern where floating objects are encoded, whether and where
            they are cross-referenced, and the relation between settings of
              <monospace>position</monospace> and appearance (and order) inside
              <monospace>floats-group</monospace>, with appropriate enforcement of these
            constraints. Otherwise it can be expected that their numbers will not always be properly
            sequenced.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Setting <monospace>orientation</monospace></title>
          <p>A number of objects also have an <monospace>orientation</monospace> attribute, which is
            intended to allow specifying that they should be rotated in display, by setting its
            value to 'landscape'.</p>
          <p>The HTML preview stylesheet does not support orientation. The PDF stylesheet does
            rotate the object; however, it assigns (somewhat arbitrarily) a width (i.e., a
              <italic>vertical</italic> spacing for an object formatted in landscape) of 6 inches
            for tables and 4 inches for other objects. While this will almost never be optimal, it
            is the best that can be accomplished without particular formatting specifications for
            each object, and it is enough to show that the orientation is set. Users may wish to
            adjust the stylesheet to meet local needs for positioning and sizing tables and
            figures.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Sizing tables</title>
          <p>In HTML, tables are sized dynamically or according to attributes given on the table
            element.</p>
          <p>In the PDF preview, by default, tables are formatted at column width. If the
              <monospace>width</monospace> attribute on a table is set to "100%" and
              <monospace>orientation</monospace> is "portrait" (the default), the entire
              <monospace>table-group</monospace> it appears in will be formatted at page width.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Footnotes</title>
          <p>The Journal Publishing model supports either of two general approaches to encoding
            footnotes in valid data. The <monospace>fn</monospace> element may be used in line where
            a reference to a footnote (generally the first or only reference) should appear, with
            the footnote content moved in rendering (typically to the bottom of the page). Or
            footnotes may be encoded together in a structured grouping, the
              <monospace>fn-group</monospace> element, and footnote references in the text are
            encoded with <monospace>xref</monospace> elements, like any other cross-reference. The
            latter style of encoding is said in the Journal Publishing documentation to be
            appropriate for "end notes" as opposed to footnotes as such.
              <monospace>fn-group</monospace> is permitted in a number of places, including within
            the article back matter and in several other locations where footnotes are commonly
            grouped in journal articles.</p>
          <p>These stylesheets will support either approach to encoding footnotes. In the HTML
            preview output, all footnotes encoded inline are grouped together in a section called
            "Notes" appearing at the end of the document. In the PDF, footnotes encoded inline are
            formatted at the foot of the page. In both cases, footnotes grouped in
              <monospace>fn-group</monospace> or in <monospace>author-notes</monospace> appear
            collected together where the <monospace>fn-group</monospace> or
              <monospace>author-notes</monospace> appears. This will usually be inside the back
            matter, but it can also occur in other places such as in the front matter,
              <monospace>boxed-text</monospace> or <monospace>table-wrap-foot</monospace>.</p>
          <p>Note that the two approaches (loose <monospace>fn</monospace> elements and
              <monospace>fn</monospace> within <monospace>fn-group</monospace>) may be combined, but
            this is inadvisable unless footnotes are numbered in the data, since it may result in
            two distinct sets of footnote numbering. It is best to encode footnotes all one way or
            all the other. Generally, if you use <monospace>fn</monospace> elements within mixed
            content, do not also use <monospace>fn-group</monospace>. If you use
              <monospace>fn-group</monospace>, use it for all footnotes and use
              <monospace>xref</monospace> to provide references to them.</p>
          <p>Additionally, in the PDF preview, errors will result if inline footnotes appear inside
            floating objects (such as boxed text or figures). This is because the XSL-FO formatter
            cannot position both a footnote and a floating object together (since when a footnote is
            moved to appear on the same page as a float, the page layout determining where the float
            can be placed may also be thrown off). This restriction means, in effect, that if you
            have footnotes in your floating objects, you must locate the footnotes inside an
              <monospace>fn-group</monospace>, and reference them with <monospace>xref</monospace>,
            rather than using <monospace>fn</monospace> elements inline.</p>

        <title>Autonumbering, labels, and cross-references</title>
        <p>Except for two element types, <monospace>ref</monospace> (reference) and
            <monospace>fn</monospace> (footnote), these preview stylesheets do not generate numbered
          labels automatically.<fn>
            <p>For projects that wish to exploit the potentials of automated processes for
              systematic numbering, the stylesheet does contain code that can be configured to
              generate labels, including autonumbering. See the <italic>Technical
                Documentation</italic> for more information.</p>
          </fn> If figures, tables and similar structures such as statements, supplementary
          material, etc. are to be labelled, they must be labelled in the data. Labels provided in
          the data (<monospace>label</monospace> elements) are displayed with the elements they
          label; the same label content also appears in cross-references that point to those
          elements when a cross-reference element (<monospace>xref</monospace> element) is given as
          empty. (When an <monospace>xref</monospace> element has text content, it is used as the
          text of the cross-reference, irrespective of whether a label appears with its target.)</p>
        <p>This approach is meant to be as transparent and easy to understand as possible: rather
          than assume any autolabeling method and format, it assumes that when labels are wanted on
          content, they will be provided explicitly in the source data, and that when a
          cross-reference is made to an object, it will either have content of its own (which can
          serve as anchoring text), or its target will have an explicit label that can be used
          unaltered as the text in the cross-reference.</p>
        <p>There are two exceptions to this principle: numbering is provided for footnotes
            (<monospace>fn</monospace> elements) and for references (<monospace>ref</monospace>
          elements) when they do not have explicit labels, as these elements' primary purpose is
          their systematic cross-referencing, and in most instances they will not function without
          labels. In both cases, explicit labels (<monospace>label</monospace> elements or, in the
          case of footnotes, <monospace>symbol</monospace> attributes) will override autogenerated
          labels, allowing for projects to control these values in their data when necessary.</p>
        <p>In all cases, to ensure legible and transparent output, warning messages may be generated
          for unlabelled elements where labels are needed (due to an empty cross-reference pointing
          to the element). This is described further below.</p>
        <p>When generated for footnotes and references, automated numbers are assigned based on the
          order of their appearance in the document, not of first references to them. (Nor are
            <monospace>ref</monospace> elements sorted to reflect their order of first reference.)
          Accordingly, in the PDF output, since footnotes are placed based on the location of the
            <monospace>fn</monospace> element in the document, a cross-reference can be made to a
          footnote that will appear on a different page. This also means that if footnote A appears
          before footnote B in the document, a reference to footnote B will appear out of sequence
          if it appears before footnote A does. The easiest ways to avoid both these problems are
          (a) to use footnotes as endnotes (group them in <monospace>fn-group</monospace> in the
          back matter) and confirm that they are placed in order of first reference; or (b) use
          inline footnotes consistently (resulting in actual footnotes in the PDF) and make sure
          that in every case, an <monospace>fn</monospace> element appears <italic>before</italic>
          any other (second or subsequent) reference to the same footnote.</p>
        <p>These stylesheets do not accommodate a practice of redundant tagging, whereby a footnote
          encoded inline is also provided with an <monospace>xref</monospace> (cross-reference)
          element to that footnote. If an <monospace>fn</monospace> element is used in line, a
          reference will appear for it. Cross-references to footnotes should be used only for end
          notes (<monospace>fn</monospace> elements in <monospace>fn-group</monospace>) or in cases
          where more than one reference is made to a single footnote.</p>

                <p>As described above, <italic>either</italic> all footnotes
                    (<monospace>fn</monospace> elements) should be enclosed in
                    <monospace>fn-group</monospace> elements (effectively, to present as endnotes),
                  in order of first reference, <italic>or else</italic> all footnotes should be
                  placed inline at their point of first reference.</p>
                <p>Avoid using (empty) <monospace>xref</monospace> elements to refer to footnotes
                  that have not yet appeared, unless the footnote is inside
                    <monospace>fn-group</monospace>, as this will result in numbering out of
                  sequence.</p>
                <p>Of course, such forward references are not a problem and need not be avoided if
                  footnotes are labelled in the source data, or if <monospace>xref</monospace>
                  elements have data content; in that case, of course, it is an editorial task to
                  maintain correct referencing and numbering.</p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p><italic>Either</italic> label all footnotes explicitly in the source data (using
                    <monospace>label</monospace> elements or <monospace>symbol</monospace>
                  attributes), <italic>or else</italic> let the system number all of them.</p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p>Similarly, <italic>either</italic> no reference elements
                    (<monospace>ref</monospace>), whether they are cross-referenced or not, should
                  be given <monospace>label</monospace> elements, <italic>or else</italic> all of
                  them should.</p>
              </list-item>
              <list-item>
                <p><italic>Either</italic> every object type (such as figures or tables) that is
                  cross-referenced should be given <monospace>label</monospace> elements
                  consistently and throughout, <italic>or else</italic> cross-references
                    (<monospace>xref</monospace> elements) should never be empty.</p>
              </list-item>
            </list></p>
          <p>As described in the <italic>Technical Documentation</italic>, the stylesheet logic

          <title>Warning messages for missing labels</title>
          <p>The logic outlined above is fairly simple (apart from the complications of footnotes
            and references), but an error condition may still arise (even in a valid document) if an
            object has no <monospace>label</monospace> element, and a cross-reference
              (<monospace>xref</monospace>) pointing to it has no content of its own. When this
            happens, a warning message will be generated in place of a label, both with the object
            and wherever it is cross-referenced. A summary view of all such warning messages is also
            provided in a special section entitled <bold>Process Warnings</bold> at the end of the
            document.</p>
          <p>This error can be corrected (1) by providing the targeted object with a
              <monospace>label</monospace> element (or alternatively, for a footnote, a
              <monospace>symbol</monospace> attribute), (2) by providing its cross-reference(s) with
            content, or (3) by doing both.</p>
          <p>When there are no such errors, the <bold>Process Warnings</bold> section does not
            appear.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Other limitations on <monospace>xref</monospace> elements</title>
          <p>The current implementation of the preview stylesheets does not support cross-references
            to more than one target using a single <monospace>xref</monospace> element. Although
            according to the DTD, an <monospace>IDREFS</monospace> value is allowed on
              <monospace>xref/@rid</monospace>, only a single <monospace>IDREF</monospace> will
            work.</p>
          <p>In other
            words,<preformat position="anchor">&lt;xref rid="fig1">See Figure 1&lt;/xref></preformat>will
            generate a cross-reference in the output,
            but<preformat position="anchor">&lt;xref rid="fig1 fig2">See Figures 1 and 2&lt;/xref></preformat>will
            not work correctly (it will attempt to link to an object identified as "fig1 fig2").</p>

        <p>Journal Publishing XML may tag bibliographic citations in any of several ways. One of
          those ways uses the <monospace>element-citation</monospace> element, which assumes that
          rendering of citations, including punctuation, is provided by a stylesheet. Stylesheets in
          this package are capable of rendering <monospace>element-citation</monospace> into two
          different bibliographic formats.<fn>
            <p>Note that even in the best of cases, it is not possible to automate the formatting of
              arbitrary bibliographic citations completely and systematically. Testing shows that
              while these stylesheets will handle the majority of common cases properly, adjustments
              often have to be made. When this occurs with the provided stylesheets, users have the
              same options as they have when they need an output format that has not been
              implemented: either extend the stylesheet to produce the desired output, or else fall
              back on manual formatting using <monospace>mixed-citation</monospace>.</p>

        <p>If your citations follow neither practice, or when your citations do not format properly
          due to special cases, you have two alternatives:</p>
        <list>
          <list-item>
            <p>Instead of <monospace>element-citation</monospace> in bibliographies or reference
              lists, use <monospace>mixed-citation</monospace> with explicit formatting. This
              element allows citations to be formatted and punctuated directly in the XML data.
              Neither preprocessing stylesheet will override any punctuation within
                <monospace>mixed-citation</monospace> elements.</p>
            <p>Even if all citations are given as punctuated <monospace>mixed-citation</monospace>
              elements, however, it is still necessary to run one or another citations preprocessor.
              This is because they may still contain elements with formatting consequences, which
              the preview stylesheets have no rules to handle. The only citations that are safe to
              run through the preview stylesheets without any preprocessing whatsoever conform to a
              profile of <monospace>mixed-citation</monospace> that includes only elements whose
              formatting consequences are inherent in their semantics,<fn>
                <p>I.e., elements such as <monospace>italic</monospace> and
                    <monospace>sup</monospace> (superscript).</p>
              </fn> and will not vary from one citation formatting style to another. See the

            <p>The main preview stylesheets (found in the <monospace>main</monospace>

                <monospace>oasis-tables</monospace> and <monospace>post</monospace>
              subdirectories);</p>

              or more of these stylesheets in sequence. These can efficiently execute a sequence of

              functionality in the Saxon processor (for those who have a recent version of
                Saxon<xref rid="saxon-versions"/> and do not wish to use XProc).</p>
          </list-item>
        </list>Users wanting a simple approach can acquire an XProc processor, or a recent version
        of Saxon, identify the pipeline or shell stylesheet that performs the necessary tasks, and
        apply it to their data.</p>
      <p>All of the stylesheets can also be run on their own, and several of them work also in XSLT
        1.0 engines. Due to limitations of the main preview stylesheets, especially limitations in
        their handling of citations (which cannot be handled generically), this is recommended only
        when citation formatting is otherwise accounted for.</p>
      <p>Publishers and content creators are free to experiment. The structure of this distribution
        is intended to provide for extensions, in the form either of new processing steps (such as a
        preprocessor for a new citation format) or modifications to existing steps. Or projects may
        wish to "unbundle" the processes and apply the stylesheets by different means altogether.

        detail.</p>
