         <code>&lt;glyph-data&gt;</code> 
         <b>Glyph Data for a Private Character</b>
      </h1>
      <p>Most characters in an XML document can be expressed as regular UnicodeÂ® codes.
            Characters not in the Unicode Standard tables have traditionally been expressed as
            explicit font calls (non-portable), created as inline graphics, or defined in one of the
            Unicode private-use areas where users may define their own characters. The <code>&lt;glyph-data&gt;</code> element is
            used when there is known to be no font available to render a private-use character. This element provides information
            on the actual glyph that is associated with the private-use character.</p>
