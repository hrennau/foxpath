         <b>X - Generated Text and Punctuation</b>
      </h1>
      <p>Generated text or punctuation. Typically used when:<ul>
            <li>
               <p>an archive decides not to have text generated on display and thus to
        pre-generate such things as commas or semicolons between keywords, or </p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>an archive receives text with <code>&lt;xx&gt;</code>
        tags embedded and wishes to retain them.</p>
            </li>
         </ul>
