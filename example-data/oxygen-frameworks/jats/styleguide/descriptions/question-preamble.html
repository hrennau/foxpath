         <b>Question Preamble</b>
      </h1>
      <p>An element containing setup/preamble information that is shared 
 by several questions. For example, a <code>&lt;question-preamble&gt;</code> might contain a diagram of a triangle (with several labeled parts) that is shared by questions such as “what is angle 'a'?”, or “Given only the information in the diagram, can you calculate the length of the line from 'b' to 'd'?” </p>
