      <h1 id="dedication">
         <code>&lt;dedication&gt;</code> 
         <b>Dedication</b>
      </h1>
      <p>A named book component that contains text dedicating the book in some fashion.</p>
      <p>
         <em>Note:</em> A publisher could choose to call this component just another <code>&lt;front-matter-part&gt;</code>, but many publishers specifically identify dedications, so this element was included in the BITS Tag Set.</p>
