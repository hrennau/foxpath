         <code>&lt;book-meta&gt;</code> 
         <b>Book Metadata (Whole Book)</b>
      </h1>
      <p>Within a <code>&lt;book&gt;</code>, such as a monograph, encyclopedia, or
reference volume, etc., the <code>&lt;book-meta&gt;</code> contains the whole-book-level
metadata elements such as book title, book identifier such as DOI, series name, edition, ISBN, et
al. This element is a direct parallel to the <code>&lt;front&gt;</code> element in NISO JATS.</p>
