      <p>Stylistically distinct word or phrase within the text that cannot be tagged using any of the other mechanisms for such content. In other words, the content cannot be described with bold, italic, monospace or any of the other emphasis elements, and <code>&lt;named-content&gt;</code> is inappropriate because the semantic reason behind the typographic distinction is unknown or not clear.</p>
