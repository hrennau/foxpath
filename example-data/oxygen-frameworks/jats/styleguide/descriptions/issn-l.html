         <b>ISSN-L (Linking ISSN)</b>
      </h1>
      <p>An ISSN designated by an ISSN Centre to group together the different media versions of a work. Since a single ISSN-L is assigned no matter how many media formats of a work there are, the ISSN-L can be used to link among the different media versions of the work or continuing resource, for example, both the printed and online versions of the work.</p>
