         <code>@collection-type</code> 
         <b>Collection, Type of</b>
      </h1>
      <p>The <code>&lt;collection-meta&gt;</code> element describes the
bibliographic metadata for a book series, book set, or other book collection of which a
<code>&lt;book-part&gt;</code> is a member. This attribute provides a
publisher-determined name for the “type” of such a collection. Expected values
include terms of publishing art such as “<code>book set</code>”, “<code>book
series</code>”, “<code>book article set</code>”. Some publishers may use this
to specify a particular book series (“<code>Out-of-Door Guidebooks</code>” or
“<code>After-school Investigations</code>”) instead
of a more general type of collection.</p>
