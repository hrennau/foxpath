      <h1 id="foreword">
         <code>&lt;foreword&gt;</code> 
         <b>Foreword</b>
      </h1>
      <p>A named book component that contains text which is called a “Foreword”; each publisher
        is free to define that term.</p>
      <p>
         <em>Note:</em> A publisher could choose to call this component just another <code>&lt;front-matter-part&gt;</code>, but many publishers specifically identify forewords, so this element was included in the BITS Tag Set.</p>
