<html xml:base="http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/wordasword.html" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><body><h1>wordasword</h1><p> A lot of technical documentation contains words that have
     overloaded meanings.  Sometimes it is useful to be able to use a word without invoking its
     technical meaning.  The <a href="wordasword.html" shape="rect"><code class="sgmltag-element">WordAsWord</code></a> element identifies a word or phrase that might otherwise be
     interpreted in some specific way, and asserts that it should be interpreted simply as a word.
