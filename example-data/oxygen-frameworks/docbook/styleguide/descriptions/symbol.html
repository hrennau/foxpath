      <a href="symbol.html" shape="rect"><code class="sgmltag-element">Symbol</code></a> is a name that
     represents a value.  It should be used in contexts in which the name will actually be replaced
     by a value before processing.  The canonical example is a <code class="literal">#define</code>d
     symbol in a C program where the C preprocessor replaces every occurance of the symbol with its
     value before compilation begins. </p></body></html>
