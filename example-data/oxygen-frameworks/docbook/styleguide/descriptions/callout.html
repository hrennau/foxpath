      "<span class="quote">callout</span>" is a visual device for associating annotations with
     an image, program listing, or similar figure. Each location is identified with a mark, and the
     annotation is identified with the same mark. This is somewhat analagous to the notion of
     footnotes in print. </p></body></html>
