         </code> element 
         represents a run of text in one document marked or  highlighted for reference purposes, due
         to its relevance in another context. When used in a  quotation or other block of text
         referred to from the prose, it indicates a highlight that was not  originally present
         but which has been added to bring the reader's attention to a part of the text  that
         might not have been considered important by the original author when the block was
         originally  written, but which is now under previously unexpected scrutiny. When used
         in the main prose of a  document, it indicates a part of the document that has been
         highlighted due to its likely  relevance to the user's current activity.
