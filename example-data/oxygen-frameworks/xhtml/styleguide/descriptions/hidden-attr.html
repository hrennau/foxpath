         </code> attribute is a 
         boolean  attribute. When specified on an element, it indicates that the element is not yet, or is no
         longer, directly relevant to the page's current state, or that it is being used to
         declare content  to be reused by other parts of the page as opposed to being directly
         accessed by the user.

            </code> attribute specified. This requirement may be implemented  indirectly through the
            style layer. For example, an HTML+CSS user agent could implement these  requirements
            
            using the rules suggested in the Rendering  section.
