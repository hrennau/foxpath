      <p>Authors are encouraged to set the 'white-space' property on 
         editing  hosts and on markup that was originally created through these editing mechanisms to the
         value 'pre-wrap'. Default HTML whitespace handling is not well suited to WYSIWYG editing,
         and line  wrapping will not work correctly in some corner cases if 'white-space' is
         left at its default  value.
