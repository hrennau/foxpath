         </code> element allows one or more spans of phrasing content to be marked with    ruby annotations.
         Ruby annotations are short runs of text presented alongside base text,    primarily
         used in East Asian typography as a guide for pronunciation or to include other   
         annotations. In Japanese, this form of typography is also known as 
         
         <i>furigana</i>. Ruby text    can appear on either side, and sometimes both sides, of the base text,
         and it is possible to    control its position using CSS. A more complete introduction
         to ruby can be found in the
