            <code>tabindex</code>
            
            
         </dfn> content attribute allows authors to  control whether an element is supposed to be
         focusable, whether it is supposed to be reachable  using sequential focus navigation,
         and what is to be the relative order of the element for the  purposes of sequential
         focus navigation. The name "tab index" comes from the common use of the  "tab" key
         to navigate through the focusable elements. The term "tabbing" refers to moving forward
         through the focusable elements that can be reached using sequential focus navigation.
