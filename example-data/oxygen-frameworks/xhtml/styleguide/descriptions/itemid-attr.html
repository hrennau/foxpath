      <p>The <code title="attr-itemid">itemid</code> attribute, if specified, must have a value that is
         a <span>valid URL potentially surrounded by spaces</span>.</p>
      
      <p>The <dfn id="global-identifier">global identifier</dfn> of an item is the value of
         its element's <code title="attr-itemid">itemid</code> attribute, if it has one, resolved relative to the element on which the attribute is specified.
         If the <code title="attr-itemid">itemid</code> attribute is missing or if resolving it fails, it
         is said to have no global identifier.</p>
