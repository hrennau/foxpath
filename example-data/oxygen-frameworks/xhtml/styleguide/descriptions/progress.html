            progress
            
            
         </code> element 
         represents the completion progress of a task.  The progress is either indeterminate, indicating
         that progress is being made but that it is not  clear how much more work remains to
         be done before the task is complete (e.g. because the task is  waiting for a remote
         host to respond), or the progress is a number in the range zero to a maximum,  giving
         the fraction of work that has so far been completed.
