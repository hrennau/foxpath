         </code> element 
         represents the document's title or name. Authors  should use titles that identify their documents
         even when they are used out of context, for  example in a user's history or bookmarks,
         or in search results. The document's title is often  different from its first heading,
         since the first heading does not have to stand alone when taken  out of context.
