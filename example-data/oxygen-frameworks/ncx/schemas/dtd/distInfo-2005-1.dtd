Description:
An XML application to describe the contents of a single piece of DTB
distribution media.  It consists of a list of books to be found on the
media.  For each book, distInfo identifies the location of each book 
within the media filesystem.  If the book is being distributed on multiple 
distribution media (media units), the distInfo book element also includes:
1) the sequence id of this media unit
2) a distribution map for the book, telling where to find all the SMIL files for a book
3) an optional list of all the files included in this distribution

The following identifiers apply to this DTD:
