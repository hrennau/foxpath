<!-- BookmarkSet: The set of bookmarks for a book consists of the title, a unique 
identifier of the book, the last place the reader left off and zero or more 
bookmarks, highlights, and associated audio or textual notes. This set is intended for 
export of bookmarks, highlights and notes to another player; the markup is not required 
for a player's internal representation of bookmarks.

<!-- uid: A globally unique identifier for the book.

<!-- Bookmark: Location and optional note. Location consists of a URI pointing to 
the id attribute of the <par> element in the SMIL file that contains the bookmark 
plus a time offset in seconds (or character offset) to the exact place.  Player should 
by default automatically number bookmarks in the order in which they fall in the book.

<!-- NcxRef: Captures current location in NCX (the id of the current navPoint)at 
time lastmark, bookmark, or highlight is set.  Ensures that current location in NCX and 
SMIL are synchronized after moving to a lastmark, etc., so that any global navigation 
commands issued by the user will start from the current location. -->

<!-- Lastmark: Location where reader left off and where player will resume play when 
restarted.

<!-- Charoffset: Exact position of bookmark in text-only file referenced (via SMIL) by the URI: 
measured in characters, counting from the start of the content of the referenced element; 
start- and end-tags are not counted, white space is then normalized (collapsed to one character).
