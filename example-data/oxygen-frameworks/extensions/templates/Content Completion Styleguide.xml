<!--
    Maps an element or attribute name to an HTML resource in order to enrich the 
    documentation (annotation) which is shown for it in the Content Completion window or in the Elements and Attributes views.
    A document type configuration has a classpath list in which the folder which contains this file needs to be added.
    This file needs to have a fixed name "contentCompletionElementsMap.xml". 
    As a working example you can look at the DITA and Docbook frameworks which have such a filter XML file already configured:
    OXYGEN_INSTALL_DIR/frameworks/dita/styleguide/contentCompletionElementsMap.xml    
-->
