      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>With just a little bit of care and preparation, any flower garden can be a vibrantly
        colored environment. Flowers can be selected for specific blooming seasons, colors and
        shapes. Both annual and perennial flower gardens can be planted depending on climate and
        specific needs.</p>

      <title>Care and Preparation</title>
      <p>When caring for your flower garden you want to feed your plants properly, control pests and
        weeds. Good soil is a must to successful gardening, landscaping, and healthy flowers. You
        have to balance the soil structure with nutrients and regulate the pH to cover your plants'
        needs. And above all, remember that many flower gardens fail because they just don't get
        enough of your attention.</p>
